Foreigners are at particular risk of street robbery in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, especially near hotels and supermarkets in the centre of town. Robberies by gangs of street children are increasingly common and can be aggressive.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies by people posing as taxi drivers or taxi customers are common in Kinshasa, and are often accompanied by a threat of violence.

Avoid displaying valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible and keep copies of documents, including your passport separately.</p>\n\n<p>Some gangs use girls to lure people into traps; others promise cut-price gold and diamonds, or pose as police or security forces.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a risk of arbitrary arrests of foreigners by security authorities who demand payment for release.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inter-communal-violence\">Inter-communal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Inter-communal violence between ethnic groups over land in Kwamouth territory of Mai-Ndombe province has been ongoing since August 2022.

Roads in Kinshasa are poorly maintained. Outside Kinshasa and other main cities, most roads are barely drivable even with a 4x4, especially during the rainy season (September to May). Consider the technical capability of your vehicle and be confident in your ability to safely operate it. Outside Kinshasa and the main cities, travel after dark brings increased risk.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of vehicle theft and car-jacking. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving and watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Don\u2019t drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.</p>\n\n<p>Security forces operate roadblocks, particularly after dark. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a check point, remain in your vehicle and show them through closed windows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>The railways are in a dilapidated state and you should be aware of the increased risk of  travel by train.

The UK does not recognise adoptions made in the DRC as the DRC is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2013 the DRC government has suspended issuing exit permits for children adopted by foreigners in DRC. This has resulted in large numbers of children adopted by foreign nationals unable to leave the country, or their departure being delayed by more than 30 months. In May 2017 the DRC Senate adopted a law banning homosexual and trans-sexual couples from adopting Congolese children. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> strongly advise families considering adoption to seek advice beforehand, including legal advice in the UK and in the DRC.

These are official fees paid when checking in. Get an official receipt plus a copy for each fee. You should hand the originals on request to immigration and at boarding, and keep the copies.</p>\n\n<p>From July 2023 the DRC government removed all COVID-19 related controls related to entry into the country.

When applying for or renewing a long term visa, DRC authorities now need a certificate of \u201cGood Conduct\u201d from your country of residence and a \u201cConsular Certificate\u201d as part of the application.

The explosions resulted in some property damage, but no injuries or deaths. Some threats have been detonated by security forces in controlled explosions. Should an incident occur near where you are, follow the instructions of police and local authorities..</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in the areas of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbios provinces, which lie outside the 20km border zone can change quickly. If you are travelling to these areas, including Cuyabeno, the Napo river, and the El Angel ecological reserve where there are a number of eco lodges, you should take local advice, pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities and be particularly cautious and vigilant. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in these areas. Travelling during daylight hours and with a reputable operator with official guides, emergency plans and good communication systems will reduce risks.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Armed robbery is a risk throughout Ecuador. Violent crime remains high in Esmeraldas and Guayas provinces, and the city of Quito, with reports of homicide, gunpoint robberies and home invasions. Most violent crime is gang-related, but tourists can get caught up inadvertently. Armed thieves have also intercepted vehicles and threatened passengers. In Guayaquil, particular caution should be exercised in the city centre and southern parts of the city, and very careful consideration should be given to any visits to Guayaquil\u2019s port installations. Seek local advice about the safety of the area you are visiting and travel in a group whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Since the end of March 2023 there has been a series of small explosions and also false bomb threats in Quito and Guayaquil linked to serious organised crime. The explosions have resulted in some property damage but as yet, no injuries or deaths. Some threats have been detonated by security forces in controlled explosions.

British Nationals are advised to avoid potential demonstrations, large gatherings and political rallies. Expect a heightened police and military presence and potential travel disruptions due to extra security checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Attacks and serious sexual assaults against foreign women increased in the town of Monta\u00f1ita (Santa Elena coastal province) in 2019 and 2020. All visitors, particularly women, should take extra care to find reputable and secure accommodation, whether travelling alone or as a group. Avoid travelling after dark and be alert to the use of date rape and other drugs in drinks. If you feel unwell, seek urgent help from the local police or nearest health centre.</p>\n\n<p>An\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncia-en-linea-violencia-contra-la-mujer/\">online report system</a>\u00a0is available for victims of gender through the \u2018Fiscal\u00eda\u2019 (Prosecutor Office).

Tourism Police units are also found in the cities of Guayaquil and Cuenca, and Santa Elena and Imbabura provinces.</p>\n\n<p>The Ecuador Attorney General\u2019s Office (Fiscal\u00eda General) now has an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncias-on-line-para-turistas/\">English online tool\u00a0for tourists to report robbery, theft and loss of belongings and documents</a> (the tool is listed under \u2018<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncias-en-linea-para-turistas/\">Denuncias online para turistas</a>\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>You can call 911 or the crime emergency line 1800-335486 for direct assistance.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Tourism has a national tourist service complaints management system <a href=\"mailto:denuncias@turismo.gob.ec\">e-mail</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-crime\">Street crime</h3>\n\n<p>Muggings and pick pocketing are common. Stay alert in public places and avoid walking alone in quiet areas or at night. Look after your belongings. Methods of robbery include distraction techniques (e.g. requests for assistance, squirting liquids on to you, staged fights and pushing or shoving), bag snatching by a passenger on a motorbike and threat of violence (with a knife or gun). In the event of a robbery, do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk. Report the matter to local police as soon as possible. If the incident takes place in a lodge or hotel, staff should be able to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Do not wear expensive jewellery when walking around, carry only the money you need for the day and take care of your credit cards. Watch your bags on public transport and wear your rucksack on the front of your body. Where possible, do not store anything under your seat or in the overhead storage on buses. There have been reports of fake bus inspectors in some Quito bus stations insisting that passengers place their luggage overhead, in order for them or an accomplice to later steal from the luggage. Do not feel that you have to place your belongings overhead.</p>\n\n<p>Carry a colour copy of your passport, including the visa entry stamp page, and keep the original safe. Only take out as much money as you need.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when withdrawing money from a bank or ATM. There have been cases of violent robbery outside banks. The Ecuadorean national police offers a free escort service from/to banks when large amounts are involved. You are encouraged to use this service, which you can request by calling 911.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnappings-and-scams\">Kidnappings and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings - short-term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - also occur. Victims can be targeted or selected at random and held while criminals empty their bank accounts with stolen cash cards. This type of crime can involve illegitimate and registered taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals may use drugs to subdue victims. Homemade versions of the drug scopolamine leave victims in a subdued, compliant state and cause amnesia. Be wary if you\u2019re approached by a stranger offering you something (food, drinks, leaflets, perfume sample etc), no matter how friendly or well-dressed they appear.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guayaquil\">Guayaquil</h3>\n\n<p>In 2023 there have been several security incidents in and around Guayaquil, including an increase in murders and small explosions. There have also been armed attacks against the police and prosecutors which have resulted in officers being killed. Whilst these incidents were not in the normal tourist areas of Guayaquil, British visitors are advised to be extra vigilant and to monitor local news and official instructions. Should an incident occur where you are, follow the instructions of police and local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-safety\">Transport safety</h2>\n\n<p>Zebra crossings are usually not respected by drivers throughout Ecuador. You should exercise extra caution when crossing roads. Driving standards are poor and traffic accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies and pickpocketing on interstate transport and at bus stations, especially in Quito, Ba\u00f1os, Cuenca, Tena, Puyo,  Riobamba, Mindo, Santo Domingo and Loja. Most incidents take place at night. Where possible you should avoid travelling by road after dark. Cases involving British nationals have been reported on various routes. Try to avoid storing your bag in overhead luggage space or underneath your seat. Keep your valuables in a safe place, preferably in a money belt or safe inside pocket.</p>\n\n<p>Using unregistered taxis significantly increases the risk of you becoming a victim of crime. Try to book a taxi through your hotel or by calling a known radio taxi service. Where possible, try to travel in a group. If you are using an authorised taxi (yellow cab) in Quito and Guayaquil make sure it has the municipality registration number sticker displayed on the windscreen and doors, and the orange license plates or the new white plates with an orange strip on the top and video cameras inside. Authorised taxi booths are present at Quito and Guayaquil international airports.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling to remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or take part in a tour with a reputable company.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Travelling to areas within 20km of the Ecuadorean border with Colombia carries significant risks due to the presence of organised crime linked to the production and trafficking of drugs. The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to this area.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in those areas of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumb\u00edos provinces, which lie outside the 20km border zone, can change quickly. If you are travelling to these areas, including Cuyabeno, the Napo river, and the El \u00c1ngel ecological reserve where there are a number of eco lodges, you should take local advice, pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities and be particularly cautious and vigilant. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in these areas. Travelling during daylight hours and with a reputable operator with official guides, emergency plans and good communication systems will reduce risks. Some lodges are a long distance from the nearest major hospital and helicopter evacuation may be necessary in an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing the northern border at Tulc\u00e1n (Rumichaca official land border point), you should enter and exit the town via the main Panamericana international highway. Lago Agrio (also known as Nueva Loja), the main town in the border province of Sucumb\u00edos, and San Lorenzo, in the border province of Esmeraldas, both lie within the 20km zone to which we advise against all but essential travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"volunteer-and-adventure-activities\">Volunteer and adventure activities</h2>\n\n<p>If you are joining a volunteer or adventure expedition programme, where possible make sure the UK organisation responsible for the travel has an official local agent in Ecuador with sufficient autonomy and resources to handle an emergency situation. Be wary of unauthorised intermediaries \u2018enganchadores\u2019 trying to offer you cheap hotels or tour deals.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy, bungee jumping, quad biking, rafting or kayaking, make sure you are fit and healthy for the activity. Use a reputable local tour operator, properly accredited to provide this service (with a specific licence).  For water adventure sports, ensure that the weather conditions and river currents are within the advisable standards. Be aware that equipment may not meet UK safety and insurance standards. Only use reputable operators, and satisfy yourself that the company is using the most up to date equipment and safety features, and that they are properly insured. Make sure your insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake. Foreigners, including British nationals, have died undertaking canopy, rafting and kayaking activities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean currents can be very strong and can change suddenly, especially around the Galapagos Islands. These current have caused deaths. Beach flags that show whether or not it is safe to swim are not found in all locations, so you should seek local advice on tidal activity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and Mountaineering</h2>\n\n<p>Due to high altitude and unpredictable climates, if you are hiking in Ecuador, including the Galapagos Islands, you should be well prepared and sufficiently fit and healthy. Ascend at a more moderate rate to give your body some time to adjust. Stay well hydrated. Don\u2019t stray from established paths and avoid exploring remote areas without an experienced guide. Make sure someone knows where you are going and when you expect to be back, and where possible, avoid walking alone, in case of any emergency.  Many rural areas of Ecuador do not have good phone signal, so you may not be able to rely on your mobile phone if you run into difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>The telef\u00e9rico (cable car) from Quito to Pichincha volcano, which overlooks the city (at 4,050 metres above sea level), is a popular day trip from the capital.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some accidents on the route to Ruco Pichincha volcano, including fatalities from hypothermia. Visitors should be aware of the risk of altitude sickness and the associated symptoms. More information about altitude sickness is available from\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/12/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a>. You should take warm and waterproof clothing, as well as high factor sun block \u2013 even on a clear day, as the weather can change quickly \u2013 and take an accredited specialised guide who knows the route well. Where possible, try to start the excursion early to minimise any potential risks related to unexpected heavy mist or storms. Tourists have been killed by electrical storms while climbing Pichincha, so you should pay close attention to the weather, and re-consider your plans if conditions look bad.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2021, a significant avalanche occurred at the Chimborazo ice-capped volcano causing the death of three climbers. Following this, Chimborazo Reserve is only open for tour operators and accredited mountaineering clubs, and with the requirement to register the visit on the \u2018Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n de Biodiversidad (SIB), via email <a href=\"mailto:chimborazo@ambiente.gob.ec\">chimborazo@ambiente.gob.ec</a>, with a minimum of 5 days\u2019 notice. It is important to note that official mountaineering restrictions can be announced at short notice. Travellers interested in undertaking climbing or mountaineering activities are advised to monitor official channels, such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ambiente.gob.ec/\">Ministry of Environment</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.turismo.gob.ec/\">Ministry of Tourism</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/goberchimborazo\">Chimborazo Local Government</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-of-traditional-hallucinogens\">Use of traditional hallucinogens</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhsinform.co.uk/health-library/articles/d/drug-misuse/introduction/\">hallucinogens</a>, often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro, are found in Ecuador. These substances are often marketed to tourists as \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019, and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen which is illegal in the UK. There are many risks involved in taking these substances and consumption is not regulated. Intoxicated travellers have been assaulted and robbed in the past. On occasions people have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases deaths.

Heavy rains and mudslides often close or wash away roads, which can cause significant delays and accidents. Driving standards are very different from the UK. Driving can be erratic, be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lanes without indicating and jumping red lights. Many local drivers do not have car insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Serious accidents are very common, mainly due to careless driving, speeding and badly maintained vehicles. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of road accidents in Latin America, which has led to many fatalities including of British Nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Always wear a seat belt. If you are a passenger in a vehicle travelling at an unsafe speed, you should firmly instruct the driver to slow down.</p>\n\n<p>If you take public buses, check the reputation of the bus company and make sure it\u2019s insured with a \u2018SPPAT\u2019 (formerly SOAT), mandatory traffic accident public insurance. There is an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.multipasajes.com/\">online interstate bus booking system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When taking yellow registered taxis in the major cities make sure the taxi meter is reset.

Some of the smaller inter-island boats do not comply with safety measures, such as holding the right licence, respecting maximum capacity for passengers, motor/fuel checks and the provision of enough life vests. Therefore, even for short journeys, British nationals are advised to use reputable boat transport operators and to ask about safety features before making a booking.

There have been cases of buses not stopping at the border, which has caused great difficulties for foreign visitors for failing to comply with immigration regulations.

The irregular \u2018El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a\u2019 climatic phenomenon occurs every few years and is due to begin in late 2023. It can cause unusually heavy rains, widespread flooding and a hotter climate across Ecuador. The risk of landslides is higher at times of heavy rainfall, which can cut off roads. Ecuador is currently under amber alert for the forthcoming El Ni\u00f1o, expected to begin in November 2023.</p>\n\n<p>During heavy rainy seasons, you should monitor local media and discuss your itinerary with your tour operator to avoid disruption. You should also avoid river crossings due to potential strong currents, and take care in affected areas. If you are planning to undertake climbing and high mountaineering, seek official advice from local authorities and tour operators. Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/inamhi\">weather forecasts</a> and be aware that the weather can change quickly. In the coastal region you should seek local advice on tidal activity and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires occur in many areas of Ecuador, but especially in Pichincha province. This is due to high temperatures, strong winds and little rain, but also people lighting fires. If you see a fire call 911.</p>\n",

Gang violence and shootings are common, and while these incidents are generally confined to inner city neighbourhoods there have been recent incidents outside of these where the risk of becoming a collateral victim does exist. Be especially cautious if you\u2019re travelling to West Kingston, Grant\u2019s Pen, August Town, Harbour View, Spanish Town and certain parts of Montego Bay, including Flankers, Barrett Town, Norwood, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem.</p>\n\n<p>The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. There are mobile police patrols, but you should take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Be vigilant at all times, even if you\u2019re staying with friends and family. Don\u2019t walk alone in isolated areas or on deserted beaches, even during the day. Take particular care when withdrawing money from ATMs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Try to vary which restaurants you use. Using the same place too often might make you a target for thieves. Avoid using buses at night.</p>\n\n<p>Most hotels and resorts are well guarded, but robberies can occur. Follow hotel security procedures. Use hotel safe, lock windows and doors and report suspicious activity. If you are in residential accommodation, make sure proper door locks and window grilles are fitted and consider employing a guard and fitting a house alarm. Gated and guarded compounds are normally the safest type of accommodation.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals and those returning to resettle permanently in Jamaica. Before returning to resettle, seek advice from the Jamaican High Commission in London and the local Jamaican Information Service. The Jamaican Constabulary Force have produced a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://jis.gov.jm/information/faqs/returning-residents-your-safety-and-security-guide-to-resettling-in-jamaica/\">safety and security guide</a> for returning citizens.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some violent incidents, including armed robbery, murder, rape and sexual assault, including the specific targeting of tourists and visitors. You should take care when using dating apps in Jamaica especially those used by the LGBT community. Criminals have used apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces and later assaulting and robbing victims. You should maintain a high level of personal safety awareness, including at popular events. The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">guidance for women travelling abroad</a> that may be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 119.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-operations\">Security operations</h3>\n\n<p>Security operations are ongoing and further activity including curfews could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you\u2019re travelling to affected areas, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.</p>\n\n<p>As part of security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica may impose a State of Emergency (SoE) or other measure with little warning. Such measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents. Police and military checkpoints may be established on roads from time to time, and full cooperation with security forces is recommended.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crowds-and-demonstrations\">Crowds and demonstrations</h2>\n<p>Public order incidents, demonstrations and large celebratory gatherings can occur across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You should avoid all demonstrations and exercise caution around large crowds; they have the potential to turn violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>The Jamaican police may impose curfews at short notice for specific towns or areas.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-and-from-norman-manley-international-airport\">Travel to and from Norman Manley International Airport</h3>\n<p>There have been outbreaks of violence in recent years in the Mountain View area on the route between Kingston and Norman Manley International Airport. Therefore, you should avoid the Mountain View Avenue route and use the alternative signposted Humming Bird route via South Camp Road instead.</p>\n\n<p>There have been police reports of British nationals being robbed when travelling to private accommodation from Norman Manley International Airport. Be especially vigilant when travelling from the airport to your accommodation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Travellers can expect delays and cancellation of flights in and out of Jamaica at short notice. These can be as a result of poor weather conditions or operational problems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive in Jamaica using a UK driving licence for up to 6 months. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Kingston, don\u2019t drive in the city. If you get lost, you risk putting yourself and your passengers in personal danger. Some hire cars and minibuses don\u2019t have seatbelts fitted in the rear. Check with the hire car company before you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Road accidents and fatalities are common. Many roads are badly maintained with poor signage. Roads in rural areas are narrow, winding and poorly lit at night. Speeding and drink-driving are common.</p>\n\n<p>Drive defensively, and take great care on the roads, whether you are in a vehicle or a pedestrian. Drivers and front seat passengers must wear seat belts at all times. Keep the windows up except when passing through a police checkpoint and doors locked. Be particularly vigilant when stopping at junctions or traffic lights. Criminals are known to use techniques which distract drivers to gain access to vehicles to steal handbags and other items of value.</p>\n\n<p>Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricanes, tropical storms and road-works can temporarily block roads. Check your route in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Only use Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) approved taxis or minibuses for excursions, airport transfers and sightseeing. Don\u2019t hail a taxi in the street and don\u2019t share a taxi with strangers. Most hotels and resorts have assigned JTB drivers who carry photo ID and display a prominent blue JTB sticker on the front windscreen.</p>\n\n",

In Jamaica, certain same-sex sexual activity is illegal. In practice these laws are rarely enforced. However, the attitude of many Jamaicans to the LGBT community is hostile. LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n",

All travellers arriving in Jamaica may still be tested for COVID-19 if assessed as high-risk as a result of exhibiting symptoms, exposure to people who have tested positive, belonging to a high-risk group or other risk factors.  Travellers may be screened for symptoms at the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regular-entry-requirements\">Regular entry requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Since 1 September 2023, all travellers are required to complete the Immigration / Customs C5 Form online before arrival in Jamaica.\u00a0 The C5 online form is free of charge and can be completed before your journey via the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://enterjamaica.com/\">PICA: Enter Jamaica</a> website. Travellers are advised only to use the official free online service and avoid misleading sites asking for payment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n<p>British nationals don\u2019t need a visa to visit Jamaica. Visitors are usually granted entry for a maximum of 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>The date by which you must leave Jamaica will be stamped in your passport. If you wish to extend your stay beyond this date you will need to apply to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.pica.gov.jm/\">Jamaican Passport, Immigration and Citizenship Agency</a>.\u00a0Overstaying without the proper authority can result in arrest and/or a fine.</p>\n\n<p>For further information about entry requirements, see the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jhcuk.org/\">Jamaican High Commission</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n<p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don\u2019t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.  There needs to be room for entry and exit stamps, but there is no minimum number of blank pages required in a passport for entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/113/jamaica#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arrival-and-departure-taxes\">Arrival and departure taxes</h3>\n<p>Arrival and departure taxes are usually included in the cost of your ticket, but this isn\u2019t always the case for charter flights. Departure tax is US $35 for air passengers. Check with your carrier if you\u2019re unsure whether the tax has been included in your ticket.  Landing fees for cruise ship passengers are usually included in the cost of the cruise.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-regulations\">Customs regulations</h3>\n<p>You can bring local currency (Jamaican dollars) into the country. However, you must declare on your customs form all currencies and monetary instruments over the value of US$10,000.</p>\n\n<p>Personal imports of meat and dairy products from the UK are banned. Customs officials may search baggage and will destroy banned foodstuffs.</p>\n",

However, protests do sometimes occur in Amman and other cities. The majority of such protests are peaceful but you should take sensible precautions, follow news reports and avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>In response to events in Israel and the OPTs, three days of national mourning were called on 18 October. A number of demonstrations have taken place in Jordan and more protests have been planned over the coming days, including after Friday prayers. Some can be spontaneous and involve large numbers of people. You should avoid demonstrations and protests.</p>\n\n<p>In Amman, protests most often take place on Thursday evenings, near the Prime Ministry at 4th Circle, and on Fridays after midday prayers near the Husseini mosque in downtown Amman. Recent protests have also taken place in the vicinity of the Israeli and US Embassies. You should take particular care if near these areas at these times. You should also take care when travelling outside Amman, especially at night, and be aware of the possibility of spontaneous demonstrations and road blockages occurring.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conflict-in-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h2>\n\n<p>On 31 October, an unidentified UAV fell in an uninhabited area east of al-Mudawwara in southern Jordan (approx 150km east of Aqaba).\u00a0 No casualties have been reported.\u00a0 The local authorities are investigating.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to within 3km of Jordan\u2019s border with Syria. The situation in southern Syria is fragile and security threats in the form of instability or terrorist activity could arise with little or no notice.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Syria. For more information, see our <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/syria\">Syria travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0also advises against all travel to the provinces in Iraq bordering Jordan. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iraq\">Iraq Travel Advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Due to recent events in Israel and the OPTs several Jordanian organisations have called for protests to head towards the border with Israel and the OPTs, particularly on Fridays. You should exercise particular caution in areas close to the border.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care at all border areas and if crossing into any neighbouring country.</p>\n\n<p>Jordanian army and police units patrol the entire border area with both Syria and Iraq. They have been known to engage vehicles and people in the border area and will continue to monitor traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups are present in Syria and Iraq, including those like Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) who routinely use kidnapping as a tactic.</p>\n\n<p>Landmines may be located near military installations and borders. Minefields are usually fenced off and marked with a skull and crossbones sign, but fences and signs may be in a poor state of repair.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"petra\">Petra</h3>\n\n<p>Petra is one of the world\u2019s most treasured UNESCO Heritage Sites and it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. It has strict opening and closing hours which all visitors should adhere to. There have been incidents of tourists being locked in Petra overnight. The ancient site and visitor centre are open to visitors daily from 6am to 6pm during the summer and 6am to 4pm in winter. Remaining within Petra outside of these hours is not permitted and could lead to arrest and prosecution. Ticket prices are displayed and anyone needing clarification should ask the tourist office staff before agreeing any additional charges.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime levels are generally low: most crime is limited to pick-pocketing, occasional bag snatching and theft from cars. Be vigilant and keep your money, passport and valuables secure.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst large numbers of foreigners enjoy visiting Amman and hiking in some of Jordan\u2019s more remote areas, women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. On occasion this can escalate and in recent years there has been an increase in reports of cases of sexual assault. Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone even during daylight hours. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK. See these <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">tips for women travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Jordanian police advise anyone who finds themselves stranded - even in daytime - to call the police on 911.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tribal-violence\">Tribal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Disputes between tribes, families, or other social disputes may develop without notice and sometimes involve violence and the use of firearms. You should follow news reports and, if caught in an incident, leave the area and follow any police instructions given.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. If you have to use a taxi ask your hotel to recommend a reliable driver. Women shouldn\u2019t ride in the front seat of a taxi, particularly when travelling alone.</p>\n\n<p>Always keep your ID documents with you. You can drive in Jordan using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. Make sure you have third party insurance. In Jordanian law a driver is always considered guilty if they hit a pedestrian. If you\u2019re involved in such an incident, you could face imprisonment and be liable for the payment of hospital bills and other compensation.</p>\n\n<p>In the rainy season (approx. November-March), the Government of Jordan sometimes issues flood alerts, particularly along the Jordan valley. These could impact on drivers and those hiking. You should be alert to potential advisories which can result in diversions and road closures. In the event of an alert affecting you, you should co-operate fully with the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>According to the latest available <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/road_safety/road_traffic_deaths2/atlas.html\">World Health Organization</a> data, Jordan ranks 48th in the world for the number of deaths per population as a result of road traffic accidents. There have been a number of fatalities recently on the Desert Highway.  You should drive with care, especially at night, and avoid driving on unlit roads. Stray animals, broken-down vehicles and unmarked road works are common. If you have an accident, don\u2019t leave the scene before the police have arrived and taken a statement. You can contact the police by calling 911.</p>\n\n<p>The police carry out random security checks. Keep identification documents with you to present at these checkpoints. The police also strictly enforce the speed limit with fixed and hand-held speed traps. The speed limit in urban areas is 40km/h; 80km/h on rural roads; and 120km/h on highways. The police  issue on-the-spot fines of between 15 to 150 Jordanian Dinars.</p>\n\n<p>Front seatbelts are required by law. Failure to wear one can result in a fine. All cars must carry a fire extinguisher and warning triangle. Using a mobile phone while driving is illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Cars and coaches can become trapped by occasional heavy snowfalls in winter and roads in mountain areas, including Petra and the surrounding area, can become blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Roads may also occasionally be blocked by political protests and demonstrations. If you encounter such an incident, cooperate fully with the police and authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adventure-travel\">Adventure travel</h2>\n\n<p>Many organisations offer trips across Jordan to take advantage of the outdoor activities on offer. The quality of these tour operators varies greatly. You should ensure you are well prepared for any outdoor activities in Jordan with appropriate clothing and sufficient food and water for what can be extreme temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>There are around 80 wadis (valleys) in Jordan. During the rainy season (November to March) there\u2019s a risk of flash floods in these valleys. Before travelling to a wadi check the weather forecast and don\u2019t travel to places where heavy rain is expected for at least one day afterwards. If you\u2019re caught in a flash flood go to a high point and don\u2019t attempt to cross the water. If you\u2019re in a vehicle try to drive to a dry spot. Contact the Civil Defence on 911 if the situation continues.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering diving or snorkelling in Aqaba, be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. Never dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make bookings through your tour representative and make sure the operator is accredited with an internationally recognised scheme such as PADI.</p>\n\n",

You should dress modestly and behave courteously.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to drink alcohol on the street but permissible in bars, clubs, hotels and private homes. There are strict alcohol limits for drivers, similar to those of the UK. If you\u2019re found guilty of drink driving you could face a driving ban, a fine or even imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in a lengthy prison sentence and a heavy fine.</p>\n\n<p>Although co-habitation for unmarried foreign couples isn\u2019t illegal, it may be frowned upon. Some landlords may ask if you are married or ask for a marriage certificate. Under local legislation, children with a Jordanian passport are not permitted to travel outside the country without their father\u2019s consent, even if they enter the country on a British passport.</p>\n\n<p>While Jordanian law does not explicitly prohibit homosexual acts, public displays of affection between homosexual couples are not generally tolerated. You could be arrested under other Jordanian laws. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly advise against bringing drones to Jordan.

Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines.

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Demonstrations in the capital Accra are normally well policed and peaceful, but sometimes they occur at short notice and can cause disruption. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ghana/safety-and-security\">Local travel</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Ghana are trouble free, but criminal activity does occur and can range from incidents of petty crime to violent crime. There was an increase in robbery, burglary and serious assault in 2021, and such attacks can include the use of weapons. There have been cases of violent robberies involving foreign nationals who have been attacked and robbed at gun-point. Street crime like pick-pocketing and bag snatching is on the increase in Accra. Take sensible precautions. Avoid carrying large sums of money or valuables, use a hotel safe whenever possible and be particularly vigilant when withdrawing cash from ATMs. Be particularly vigilant at night (after 6:30pm), and avoid travelling alone.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks on passengers in vehicles are also on the increase. Take particular care when stationary. Keep windows up and doors locked. Some of these attacks on vehicles also involve the use of weapons. A British national died in one such attack in August 2021. Make long trips during daylight hours, travel in convoys, and seek advice from local police before travelling along long sections of open road (see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/ghana/safety-and-security#road-travel\">Road travel</a>).  Local police also highlight the risk of attacks on vehicles when driving the Tamale-Wa road, at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Take care at public beaches and avoid going to the beach on your own. Theft is the main problem, but there have been isolated incidents of violent crime and sexual assault in areas popular with tourists.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of luggage and travel documents occurs at Kotoka International Airport and in hotels. Make sure your passport is secure at all times and don\u2019t leave baggage unattended. Be wary of offers of help at the airport unless from uniformed porters or officials. All permanent staff at the airport wear an ID card showing their name and a photo. ID cards without a photo are not valid. If you are being collected at the airport, confirm the identity of your driver by asking for ID. British nationals have been robbed by impostors who have approached them before the main arrivals area pretending to be their driver.</p>\n\n<p>The main locations of risk in Greater Accra highlighted by the police are: Graphic Road, George Walker Bush Highway, Accra Mall Roundabout, Awudome Cemetary Road, Pokuase-Amasaman Road, Teshie-Nungua road, Labadi beach area, GIMPA road and surrounding areas, and the Kokrobite beach area. You should be especially vigilant in these locations.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you lock windows and secure accommodation both at night and before you go out. There have been cases of burglaries in areas used by the international community, including Airport Residential, Cantonments, Ridge and Kokrobite, with increased frequency over the Christmas period.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports in the media of criminally-motivated kidnapping in Accra, Takoradi, and Kumasi, including the targeting of foreign nationals. Kidnaps can be for financial or political gain, or can be motivated by criminality. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence in Ghana is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam\u00a0artists operating in West Africa. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk\">scams come in many forms</a> - romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<p>If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Ghana you should make sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British High Commission in Accra.</p>\n\n<p>If you have sent money to someone you believe has scammed you and are contacted by a police officer for more money to help get your money back, then this is possibly another part of the scam. Scam artists have also been known to use the identity of officials at the British High Commission in Accra. If you receive an email from someone claiming to be an official at the British High Commission, contact the officer using the phone numbers or contact details for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-accra\">British High Commission</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>As a result of occasional local Chieftaincy, land disputes and political tension, isolated inter-ethnic violence and civil unrest can occur at any time across Ghana.</p>\n\n<p>Localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice, and can become violent (sometimes involving weapons). Avoid large crowds and political protests. If you\u2019re in these areas, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities. If this does happen, local police may impose curfews to contain the situation. Curfews usually run from 7pm to 5am but these times can vary. The Interior Ministry may put out a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mint.gov.gh/category/press-release/\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increased Ghanaian military presence in Upper East to strengthen security, centred around the town of Bawku. In the past few months, tension has risen with an increase in violent incidents in and around Bawku. These happen with little warning and have resulted in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>Regular curfews have been put in place in Bawku, with requirements and times changing. Security checks, including road blocks, are also often in effect and you should be prepared to show identification if asked. You should be prepared for the security response to change without notice. Visitors are strongly advised to contact the regional Police Headquarters in Bolgatanga town before travelling to Bawku and neighbouring towns.</p>\n\n<p>Flooding is common in the Upper West, North East, Northern and Savannah regions during the rainy season (March to November). You should monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.</p>\n\n<p>If you are transiting through Burkina Faso, read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso\">Burkina Faso travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In an emergency, visitors should contact Police on 191, and follow the advice of emergency services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Ghana using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a local driving licence. A UK driving licence is not valid. If you\u2019re applying for a local driving licence from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.eservices.gov.gh/DVLA/SitePages/DVLA-Home.aspx\">Ghana DVLA</a>,\nyou must get your UK driving licence authenticated by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency\">UK DVLA</a>. You should carry your driving licence or International Driving Permit with you at all times when driving. An International Driving Permit is usually valid for a year and it cannot be renewed in Ghana.</p>\n\n<p>Roads can be in a poor condition, particularly in rural areas. Street lighting is poor or non-existent. Avoid travelling by road outside the main towns after dark, when the risk of serious road accidents is much greater, and there is a heightened risk of attacks on vehicles (see Crime section). Grass or leaves strewn in the road often means an accident or other hazard ahead. If you choose to drive at night be aware of impromptu police checkpoints. Do not give cash to the police.</p>\n\n<p>Safety standards of taxi services in Ghana are often low. There have also been isolated incidents of crime taking place in all types of taxis (including licensed taxis, \u2018Tro Tros\u2019 and app-based taxi services). If you travel by taxi, we recommend you use licensed taxis only, making sure to check driver IDs and the vehicle condition before you travel. Avoid travelling alone in taxis after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike official taxis, drivers of \u2018Tro-Tros\u2019 and popular app-based taxi services are not centrally licensed. Driver training and vehicles standards will vary from those expected from similar service providers in the UK, and app-based safety features are rarely monitored centrally. Don\u2019t use \u2018Tro-Tros\u2019 outside the major towns and cities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9G\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Ghana.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been attacks against ships in and around Accra\u2019s waters.

International borders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) could close at short notice.

This is primarily to facilitate the evacuation of seriously wounded Palestinians and some foreign nationals. We understand that the crossing will continue to be open for controlled and time-limited periods to allow specific groups of foreign nationals, including British nationals, to cross. It is for the Egyptian and Israeli authorities to determine who is permitted to cross, and when. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will contact Embassies to let them know when their foreign nationals can cross. Should we receive notification from the Israeli and Egyptian authorities that individuals are permitted to cross, we will notify those people individually.</p>\n\n<p>Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.

The specific requirements for the visa are listed on the website.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you wish to get a visa on arrival, you can do so at approved bank kiosks within airport arrival halls, before reaching immigration counters. The visa fee is 25  US dollars, payable in dollars as the preferred currency, although you may also be able to pay in pounds sterling or euros. Visas granted on arrival are valid for a maximum of 30 days. There\u2019s no need to buy a visa from an agent. In many cases agents will charge more than US$25 for a visa.

If you intend to travel out of these areas or stay longer than 15 days, you must get a visa.</p>\n\n<p>If you have travelled to one of the South Sinai Red Sea resorts, entered without a visa and your plans have changed, you can normally purchase a visa at Sharm el Sheikh airport to allow you to travel elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Applications for visa extensions should be made at Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. You may have difficulties leaving Egypt with an out of date visa. You will normally have to pay a fine if your visa is out of date by more than 14 days.</p>\n\n<p>For further information and enquiries, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://egyptconsulate.co.uk/visas/\">Egyptian Consulate in London</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visa-extensions\">Visa extensions</h3>\n\n<p>Apply for visa extensions at the Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices.

Depending on the country you\u2019re arriving from, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cairo-airport.com/en-us/Services/Passenger-Guide/Customs-Regulations\">goods that can be brought into and taken out of Egypt</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re allowed to bring in or take out up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds.

Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Egyptian security forces</li>\n  <li>religious sites</li>\n  <li>large public gatherings</li>\n  <li>places visited by foreigners</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The authorities in Egypt have a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers at important sites, critical infrastructure and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites. Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, an attack to the west of the Suez Canal targeting security forces within the city of Ismailiyah</li>\n  <li>in 2019, at least 20 people killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo\u2019s Manial district</li>\n  <li>in 2019, at least 16 people injured after an IED attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids</li>\n  <li>in 2019, 3 security personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo\u2019s Darb al-ahmar district</li>\n  <li>in 2018, a roadside blast killed 4 people on a bus near the Giza pyramids</li>\n  <li>in 2018, gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Minya province killing 7 people. Daesh (formally ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-during-holiday-periods\">Terrorism during holiday periods</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorism in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas in January). Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. See a list of public holidays on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.presidency.eg/en/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/\">Egyptian Presidency website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow the advice of Egyptian authorities</li>\n  <li>be vigilant in crowds and large gatherings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"airports-and-airlines\">Airports and airlines</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorists in Egypt have the intent and capability to target airport buildings and planes.</p>\n\n<p>The main threat is on the North Sinai Peninsula where Daesh operate with greater freedom, but terrorists are active throughout Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Co-operate fully with security officials at airports and pay attention to security measures on flights from Egypt to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have taken foreigners, government officials and civilians hostage for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnappings are likely.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Since 2011 there has been significant political turmoil. The political environment remains restrictive. There have been violent protests and disturbances, resulting in a number of deaths.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations occur across Egypt, particularly in cities. Avoid protests, marches or demonstrations as the situation could change quickly and without warning. Police have used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition as crowd control.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities may close public spaces, including parks and beaches, at short notice, particularly around the holidays. Follow the guidance of the local authorities. You could be fined or arrested if you do not do as you are told.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners involved in any political activity or activities critical of the government may be at risk of detention or other measures.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports that personal electronic devices are being checked by security personnel, particularly around places of public gathering, such as Tahrir Square.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>The crime rate is generally low, but visitors have reported armed robberies, muggings (including in taxis), sexual assaults, and break-ins to accommodation and cars. Take extra care when travelling alone, particularly at night, in taxis and microbuses.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to report a crime, contact the tourist police on 122. If you do not report a crime before you leave, it will be difficult to ask for a prosecution at a later date.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assaults-and-harassment\">Sexual assaults and harassment</h3>\n\n<p>There are a number of sexual assaults reported to the British Embassy, including cases involving minors.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of cases that have been reported took place in tourist resorts in the Red Sea region, often\u00a0committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff.\u00a0There have also been reports of hotel staff discouraging incidents being reported to local police.</p>\n\n<p>Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra precautions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>make sure children and young people are always accompanied by known and trusted people and not left alone with hotel or excursion staff</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>don\u2019t allow hotel staff to enter your room when you are alone. Try to ensure a friend or relative is present</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>avoid travelling in a taxi alone. If this isn\u2019t possible, apply extra security to your trip by sharing the details of your driver and trip with a friend, and using live location on WhatsApp</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>use reputable providers for any services and excursions, and carry out research beforehand, including by consulting your tour operator where you have one</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>avoid sharing personal contact or social media details</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also want to read:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad\">information for British nationals affected by rape or sexual assault abroad</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you experience sexual harassment or assault, or anything you see doesn\u2019t feel right, report it to the hotel or local authorities - Tourist Police on 126 or if you are resident in Egypt you should call the Police on 122 and contact the British Embassy at +20 2 27916000 as soon as possible for advice and support.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Keep a copy of your passport, visa and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on bikes and snatch valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers and touts target foreigners.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"staying-safe-at-tourist-sites\">Staying safe at tourist sites</h3>\n\n<p>Tourists at popular tourist sites, such as the Giza Pyramids, may be confronted aggressively for money or business, even while travelling by car or taxi. Visitors using a pre-booked guide, or taking an organised tour to visit the Giza Pyramids, are likely to face fewer difficulties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Egypt is predominantly an Islamic country. It is illegal to encourage conversion to the Christian faith.</p>\n\n<p>Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Make sure your actions do not cause offence, especially during Ramadan or when you visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>Dress modestly, especially in rural areas, mosques and souqs (markets). Public displays of affection are frowned on. What may be acceptable in the tourist resort areas may not be in other areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Ramadan in Egypt in 2024 will likely begin in March and end in April and will last for 30 days. Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police regularly carry out ID checks. Keep valid photo ID with you at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Drinking alcohol anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar is illegal and can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs is a serious offence and can, even for small amounts, lead to lengthy prison sentences (25 years), life imprisonment or the death penalty. Those sentenced to life imprisonment on drugs charges will normally spend the rest of their life in prison with no possibility of parole or pardon.</p>\n\n<p>Khat is illegal in Egypt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticising-the-egyptian-government\">Criticising the Egyptian government</h3>\n\n<p>Making political or negative comments about the Egyptian government, including about the President or security forces, can cause trouble with the authorities. People have faced prison sentences for making insulting comments on social media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"restrictions-on-photography\">Restrictions on photography</h3>\n\n<p>You need a permit for professional photography or film equipment. This includes photography umbrellas, artificial outdoor lighting gear, and any equipment that occupies or blocks public roads.</p>\n\n<p>You are not allowed to take or share photographs that could be considered damaging to the country\u2019s image. You can only take photographs of Egyptian citizens can if you have their written permission. Do not photograph officials without their consent. Taking pictures of children is not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Photography of, or near, military property is strictly banned. This includes the Suez Canal. There are sensitivities about taking photographs of embassies, government buildings, churches and religious buildings. British nationals have been arrested for photographing churches, electricity stations, train stations and bridges. If you are in any doubt, get permission before taking photographs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>Do not use radio controlled helicopters or \u2018drones\u2019 to take photographs.</p>\n\n<p>The import, production or use of drones is banned in Egypt unless you have prior authorisation from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mod.gov.eg/ModWebSite/Default.aspx\">Egyptian Ministry of Defence</a>. Anyone who uses or imports drones without authorisation could be sent to prison for up to 7 years or fined 5,000 to 50,000 Egyptian pounds.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is not explicitly criminalised in Egypt, but LGBT+ people have been prosecuted under the law of \u2018debauchery\u2019. People have been arrested for flying rainbow flags at public events on debauchery charges.</p>\n\n<p>There is little public acceptance of homosexuality in Egypt. Public expressions of homosexuality or displays of affection between same-sex couples are likely to get negative attention. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page for the LGBT+ community</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious about sharing content or having discussions of a sexual nature on social media, especially about sexual acts that are considered illegal. Some travellers have been arrested and imprisoned for this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"children-and-young-people\">Children and young people</h3>\n\n<p>Egyptian family law is very different from UK law, particularly around child custody. See <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-parental-child-abduction\">guidance for those affected by international parental child abduction</a> and how to get assistance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"insurance-for-adventure-activities\">Insurance for adventure activities</h3>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance, or the tour or dive company, covers the costs for any air or sea rescue. The current fee can exceed 4,000 US dollars per hour. The Egyptian authorities will only undertake rescue operations when there\u2019s a guarantee of payment. Book excursions for activities at your resort or through approved agents or tour operators.</p>\n\n<p>See <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance guidance</a>  for more information on travel insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hot-air-balloons\">Hot air balloons</h3>\n\n<p>Some UK tour operators have not been able to verify the safety standards for balloon flight operators and have stopped selling balloon flights. There have been a number of injuries and fatal accidents. Speak to your tour company before booking.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving-and-snorkelling\">Diving and snorkelling</h3>\n\n<p>Safety standards of diving operators in Red Sea resorts vary considerably. Never dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make bookings through your tour representative. Very cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards. Diving beyond the depth limit of your insurance policy will invalidate your cover.</p>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are rare, but there have been a number involving tourists in the Red Sea region. Monitor any updates from local authorities or your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quad-bikes-and-desert-visits\">Quad bikes and desert visits</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several serious quad bike accidents involving British nationals in resort areas. Take the same precautions as you would in the UK. Safety standards can vary considerably. Always wear a crash helmet.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk from unexploded landmines in some desert areas, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in the north west of Egypt near to Alamein</li>\n  <li>on some limited stretches of the Mediterranean coast near Marsa Matrouh</li>\n  <li>on the Red Sea coast south of Suez</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dangerous areas are usually well marked with signs and barbed wire fencing. Take care and follow local advice, especially if planning trips off marked roads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Egypt, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Egypt on an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> for up to 6 months. If you intend to stay in Egypt for a longer period you must apply for an Egyptian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>You may not be allowed to import a vehicle into Egypt. If you want to bring in a vehicle temporarily, you will need a \u2018carnet de passage\u2019 from the Automobile Association.</p>\n\n<p>Accidents are common because of poor road conditions, dangerous driving and poor enforcement of traffic laws. Do not drive outside main cities and resorts at night. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling off-road, employ a qualified guide and get a permit from the Ministry of Interior.</p>\n\n<p>You must wear a seatbelt in the front of a vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-and-bus-travel\">Rail and bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been serious bus crashes in recent years with large numbers of fatalities, including tourists.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been fatal train collisions and derailments.</p>\n\n<p>Suspect devices have been found at train stations and on the rail network. Although some have been hoaxes or false alarms you should be vigilant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Overcrowding and poor safety standards have led to several accidents on Red Sea ferries and Nile cruisers.</p>\n\n",

We recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. If your reason to remain in Israel and the OPTs is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in an area affected by the fighting,\u00a0follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command.

There is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces, and civilians (including Israeli settlers). There is a risk that bystanders could be caught up in any of these types of incident.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been large political demonstrations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which have the potential to escalate and become violent. Entry/exit to Ben Gurion Airport has occasionally been impacted during political demonstrations. Check the local news to see if there have been recent clashes, be vigilant, avoid any large gatherings or demonstrations, avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence and follow the instructions of the local authorities. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, you should stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents have occurred in Tel Aviv, Be\u2019er Sheva, Hadera, Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly at and around Damascus Gate, Herod\u2019s gate, Lion\u2019s Gate and the Chain Gate), Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, the Jordan Valley, at Israeli checkpoints, near settlement outposts, and around Palestinian refugee camps. Hebron and Palestinian refugee camps have previously been the site of violent clashes, settlements and settlement outposts have been the site of recent violent incidents (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have also occurred along Route 60 (especially junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth), during Ramadan, in particular Laylat Al Qadr (dates vary), Thursday evenings, after Friday prayers, Saturday evenings and on other religious holidays and anniversaries. This is heightened when different religious or national holidays overlap. Independence Day (14 May, Hebrew calendar dates vary), Jerusalem Day (date varies), Land Day (30 March) and Nakba Day (15 May) may be tense. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. You should exercise extreme caution: follow local media and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>\u00a0and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.

Some of these protests have led to violent clashes. Stay alert at all times in the Old City and leave the area if there is evidence of tension or unrest (for example if the shops in the souks suddenly begin to close their shutters). The entrances to the Old City may be subject to checks or closures.</p>\n\n<p>Street protests and demonstrations can also occur elsewhere in East Jerusalem. You should be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. You should check the local news in advance and avoid areas which have been the site of recent clashes or violence.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent incidents including terrorist attacks on public transport and near public transport lines in Jerusalem.

You should not approach the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0can no longer offer routine consular assistance in Gaza. If you travel to Gaza you should review your security arrangements regularly. Protests may occur in central Gaza City and along the perimeter fence with Israel. You should exercise extreme caution and avoid demonstrations or large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>The border crossings with Israel (Erez) and Egypt (Rafah) may close with no advance notice. Check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.</p>\n\n<p>During periods of conflict between the de facto Hamas authorities and the Israeli government, the Israeli Air Forces may launch air strikes against targets inside Gaza. There will be no warning siren inside Gaza and there are no official air raid shelters. You should take advice from locals about the safest place to shelter.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel/entry-requirements#entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</a></p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recognises the need for major international organisations to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction work and to engage in independent reporting and verification of the situation on the ground in Gaza. Medical and other essential specialist staff should co-ordinate their entry to and exit from Gaza with those organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to enter Gaza by sea, including via a flotilla. The Israeli Navy routinely patrols the area and have made clear that it will prevent any vessels attempting to breach the restrictions. You will be detained and deported, and your electronic equipment is likely to be confiscated. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> does not believe that humanitarian supplies should be delivered in this way. Anyone wishing to send humanitarian assistance or other goods to Gaza should do so through established channels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"occupied-golan-heights\">Occupied Golan Heights</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 500m of the border with Syria (the \u2018Alpha Line\u2019).</p>\n\n<p>While the risks have decreased since Syrian Golan became more stable in 2018, rocket attacks and sporadic gunfire have occurred in northern Israel without warning since 2012. There is also a risk of falling debris from Israeli and Syrian air-defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Land mines have also been planted in lots of places across the Occupied Golan Heights, including near to populated areas and roads. These areas are usually marked, and are often fenced off. Follow established roads and paths, and do not hike off trail. If you are travelling in the region, follow advice from local law enforcement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-lebanon\">Border with Lebanon</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 5km of the border with Lebanon. The Israeli military have announced that the area is a closed military zone and entry into the area is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the Sheba\u2019a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the \u2018Blue Line\u2019) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town. If travelling near areas of military operation, adhere to all Israeli official instructions.</p>\n\n<p>The situation on the ground could change quickly. On 7 April 2023, Israel carried out strikes against targets in southern Lebanon in response to rockets launched on 6 April 2023 from southern Lebanon into Israel. On 20 July 2020 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line. You should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-egypt\">Border with Egypt</h3>\n\n<p>The security situation on the border with Egypt remains volatile. Take extra care and be vigilant when using Route 10 which runs along the Israeli border with Egypt and is subject to closures by the Israeli authorities. You may wish to consider using other routes.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent clashes between Israeli Security Forces and Palestinians in these areas and violent incidents can occur without warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"west-bank\">West Bank</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. There has been a heightened state of tension and violent clashes resulting in deaths in the West Bank since the outbreak of conflict on 7 October. .</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0There are road closures and numerous checkpoints across the West Bank. Travel in and out of the West Bank is not possible without passing through at least one Israeli military checkpoint. You will need a passport and immigration slip to go through these checkpoints. Checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. Please refer to the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Access Coordination Unit</a>\u00a0for information (which is subject to change).</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities sometimes restrict movement in and out of the West Bank, either on Jewish High Holidays, Israeli national holidays or as a result of a security incident. This doesn\u2019t normally affect foreign nationals, but would affect dual Palestinian-British nationals. Road closures can occur with little notice. Keep up to date with local travel updates.</p>\n\n<p>The cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho see large numbers of tourists including on organised tours and there have been no recent reports of any serious incidents involving foreigners. However, take care when travelling anywhere in the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers. Check the local news before travelling to see if there have been recent clashes and avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have occurred in Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, at Israeli checkpoints, around Palestinian refugee camps and along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis. Be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. Check the local news in advance and avoid travelling to areas which have been the site of recent violence. Exercise extreme caution when driving on these routes, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>Israelis living in the illegal settlements in the West Bank occasionally organise demonstrations in the West Bank which sometimes turn violent. There are also a number of reports of settlers threatening those travelling near to settlements and settlement outposts. Take particular care if you are near settlements, including those in the hills around Nablus and in the South Hebron hills and settlement outposts (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). There is a closed military zone in the H2 area of Hebron (around Ash-Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs), where there is a risk of a hostile reaction from members of extremist groups.</p>\n\n<p>Due to a significant number of road traffic accidents involving taxis in the West Bank, you\u2019re advised not to use them where possible. Avoid using buses on the West Bank and keep in mind the difficulties and risks associated with travelling between Jerusalem/Ramallah via checkpoints and the risks associated with travelling along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on travel, the ability of the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0to provide consular assistance in the West Bank may be limited. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recommends all British nationals in Israel and the OPTs register their presence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are trouble-free, but the theft of passports, credit cards, and valuables from public beaches is common. Keep your personal belongings in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Crime is generally not a problem in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, but you should take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-security\">Passport security</h2>\n<p>A Serious Organised Crime Agency investigation into the misuse of UK passports in the murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in Dubai in January 2010 found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports. This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. Only hand your passport over to others (including Israeli officials) when absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is erratic, maintenance of public buses is variable, and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on roads within Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, and fines for speeding are high.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in the West Bank, check that you are insured before setting out. It may be easier to arrange West Bank insurance at a hire company in East Jerusalem than from the major hire car companies in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It is not safe to hitchhike in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to the desert, go with others, take a supply of water and a mobile phone, and let someone know your itinerary and expected time of return.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 355 road deaths in the Israel (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 3.9 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Our advice against all travel to the West Bank does not apply to Route 1 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</p>\n\n",

Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are ongoing Israeli air strikes into Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are very likely to continue with an increased threat of attacks, including by individuals acting alone.</p>\n\n<p>Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Old City in Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>government, military and police installations</li>\n  <li>security personnel including military and police</li>\n  <li>transport networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with Western interests</li>\n  <li>crowded places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of recent significant attacks include:</p>\n\n<p>In 2023:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 people were killed and one\u00a0 injured during a shooting attack in the Jordan Valley</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 6 people\u00a0 injured during a car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 3 people injured in a shooting attack in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>7 people were killed and 3 injured during a shooting attack in Neve Yaakov, East Jerusalem</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2022:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 people were killed and 22 people injured during 2 explosions in West Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>3 people were killed and 4 injured during a stabbing attack</li>\n  <li>2 Israelis were killed and 10 injured during a shooting attack in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>5 Israelis were killed in a terrorist shooting incident in Bne Brak</li>\n  <li>2 Israelis were killed and 4 injured in a terrorist shooting incident in Hadera</li>\n  <li>4 people were killed and 2 others injured in a ramming and stabbing incident in Ber Sheva</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnap is a risk in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. There is a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza and Hamas has reportedly taken hostages across the border and into the Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

You can find locations of ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and towns in travel guides and online.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid driving into ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of Jerusalem on Shabbat (from sunset on Friday to nightfall (approximately 1 hour after sunset) on Saturday).  If you attempt to drive into these areas local residents may throw stones at your car.</p>\n\n<p>During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset is forbidden for Muslims (though not for children under the age of 8). Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, you should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places in the Occupied Palestinian Territories during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year, you can look them up online. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<p>Be sensitive about taking pictures of people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. Don\u2019t take photographs of military or police personnel or installations.</p>\n\n<p>Carry identification with you at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details and entry stamp pages of your passport).</p>\n\n<p>The penalties for smuggling and trafficking in illegal drugs are severe. Those caught in possession can expect a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10 year prison sentence. Attitudes towards LGBT issues within some parts of Palestinian and Israeli society can be hostile. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention on the West Bank in more conservative Israeli areas, including ultra-Orthodox communities. Homosexuality is largely taboo in Palestinian society.</p>\n\n<p>Some Palestinian groups may violently oppose events, cultural events and demonstrations, which they consider to be inconsistent with their own values. This includes those perceived to be linked to the LGBT+ community, even if the event is not intended to promote LGBT+ rights. In these cases, the Palestinian security forces and police may not always act effectively to protect participants. You should be aware of these risks. You should liaise with the local authorities before planning or organising any event.</p>\n\n<p>Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT community and is famous for its annual Pride Parade. An annual Pride Parade is also held in Jerusalem, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing occurred during the 2015 parade. You should exercise extra vigilance if attending. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Israel is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you are caught breaking local laws on import and export of wild animals you can expect to receive a substantial fine and up to 2 years in prison.

If you\u2019re unsure how Israel and The Occupied Palestinian Territories\u2019 entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported. This process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country\u2019s immigration policy or procedures.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you\u2019re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.</p>\n\n<p>At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states \u2018Palestinian Authority only\u2019 or \u2018Judea and Samaria only\u2019. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2017, the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Contact the Israeli embassy</a> if you need further information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-other-countries\">Previous Travel to Other Countries</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a> prior to arrival.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-and-immigration\">Customs and Immigration</h3>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. You may experience lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Searches and questioning may be longer in some cases, including but not limited to some visitors with Palestinian or Arab ancestry with evidence of previous travel which may be considered suspicious, or those who are considered to have publicly criticised the state of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Airside Immigration officials occasionally ask travellers to wait whilst further checks are conducted. This is not routine procedure, but a small number of travellers do experience delays, some for several hours. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can legally be refused entry if they have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or if they belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refusal-of-entry-into-israel\">Refusal of entry into Israel</h3>\n\n<p>If in the rare event you are refused entry to Israel you will be booked on the next available flight back to the port from which you entered Israel and on the same airline. Depending on the flight schedule you may be taken to the Immigration Detention Centre located a few minutes\u2019 drive from the airport. You will remain there until your flight departs. Whilst there you will have access to a telephone, information in English, and medical assistance if required. Your luggage will remain at the airport so you will need to highlight to officials if you need to retrieve anything urgent from your luggage, for example medication. The Embassy is contactable from the Detention Centre and can assist where possible. But the Embassy cannot intervene with immigration decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h3>\n\n<p>Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and Israeli immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs.</p>\n\n<p>On 20 October 2022, the Government of Israel introduced new requirements for foreign nationals entering and residing in the West Bank. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/departments/policies/judeaentry2022\">You can find more information on the requirements and points of contact for enquiries via the Israeli government website.</a></p>\n\n<p>Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that they are not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. This is unless they obtain advance authorisation from the Israeli \u2018Territory Actions Co-ordinator\u2019, violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>You may be detained on arrival to Israel and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you are entering Israel for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. If you decide to visit Gaza against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you will need to contact the relevant authorities well in advance. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is no longer able to provide administrative support for UK charities wishing to enter Gaza via the Rafah crossing. The Rafah border regularly closes with no warning and for long periods of time. The Erez border also sometimes closes with no warning. At these times it may be impossible to enter or leave Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Please refer to this website for information</a> (which is subject to change).\u00a0 For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"british-nationals-of-palestinian-origin\">British nationals of Palestinian origin</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a British national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave Gaza or the West Bank. If you are a British national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of British nationals of Palestinian origin or British nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h3>\n\n<p>British-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Allenby and Rafah border crossings (respectively) with Jordan and Egypt and return via the same route. Please note: British/Palestinian dual nationals entering Gaza, which is against our Travel Advice, should check with the relevant authorities on entry/exit procedures. Numbers of such dual nationals permitted to enter and exit Gaza via Erez are very limited and include medical, humanitarian cases and aid workers. The final decision on entry and exit permits via Erez always rests with the Israeli authorities</p>\n\n<p>If you are a dual national check with your nearest Israeli Embassy if pre-approval is required for travel to Israel. Dual nationals holding Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, and Lebanese citizenship have previously been impacted. If you are not a citizen of any of these countries, but have close family ties, it is also advisable to check with your nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<p>Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19\">COVID-19</h2>\n\n<p>Entry requirements for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://corona.health.gov.il/en/abroad/\">the Ministry of Health</a> pages for full details.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

The Israeli military announced on 13 October that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>As of 27 October, Israeli Defence Forces have significantly expanded operations.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware of a potential increase in rocket attacks and other incidents of violence across Israel and the OPTs, including the West Bank, and Eilat and the Red Sea area.  We recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. If your reason to remain in Israel and the OPTs is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in an area affected by the fighting,\u00a0follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command.

These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces, and civilians (including Israeli settlers). There is a risk that bystanders could be caught up in any of these types of incident.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been large political demonstrations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which have the potential to escalate and become violent. Entry/exit to Ben Gurion Airport has occasionally been impacted during political demonstrations. Check the local news to see if there have been recent clashes, be vigilant, avoid any large gatherings or demonstrations, avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence and follow the instructions of the local authorities. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, you should stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents have occurred in Tel Aviv, Be\u2019er Sheva, Hadera, Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly at and around Damascus Gate, Herod\u2019s gate, Lion\u2019s Gate and the Chain Gate), Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, the Jordan Valley, at Israeli checkpoints, near settlement outposts, and around Palestinian refugee camps. Hebron and Palestinian refugee camps have previously been the site of violent clashes, settlements and settlement outposts have been the site of recent violent incidents (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have also occurred along Route 60 (especially junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth), during Ramadan, in particular Laylat Al Qadr (dates vary), Thursday evenings, after Friday prayers, Saturday evenings and on other religious holidays and anniversaries. This is heightened when different religious or national holidays overlap. Independence Day (14 May, Hebrew calendar dates vary), Jerusalem Day (date varies), Land Day (30 March) and Nakba Day (15 May) may be tense. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. You should exercise extreme caution: follow local media and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>\u00a0and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.

Some of these protests have led to violent clashes. Stay alert at all times in the Old City and leave the area if there is evidence of tension or unrest (for example if the shops in the souks suddenly begin to close their shutters). The entrances to the Old City may be subject to checks or closures.</p>\n\n<p>Street protests and demonstrations can also occur elsewhere in East Jerusalem. You should be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. You should check the local news in advance and avoid areas which have been the site of recent clashes or violence.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent incidents including terrorist attacks on public transport and near public transport lines in Jerusalem.

You should not approach the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0can no longer offer routine consular assistance in Gaza. If you travel to Gaza you should review your security arrangements regularly. Protests may occur in central Gaza City and along the perimeter fence with Israel. You should exercise extreme caution and avoid demonstrations or large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>The border crossings with Israel (Erez) and Egypt (Rafah) may close with no advance notice. Check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.</p>\n\n<p>During periods of conflict between the de facto Hamas authorities and the Israeli government, the Israeli Air Forces may launch air strikes against targets inside Gaza. There will be no warning siren inside Gaza and there are no official air raid shelters. You should take advice from locals about the safest place to shelter.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza.

Medical and other essential specialist staff should co-ordinate their entry to and exit from Gaza with those organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to enter Gaza by sea, including via a flotilla. The Israeli Navy routinely patrols the area and have made clear that it will prevent any vessels attempting to breach the restrictions. You will be detained and deported, and your electronic equipment is likely to be confiscated. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> does not believe that humanitarian supplies should be delivered in this way. Anyone wishing to send humanitarian assistance or other goods to Gaza should do so through established channels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"occupied-golan-heights\">Occupied Golan Heights</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 500m of the border with Syria (the \u2018Alpha Line\u2019).</p>\n\n<p>While the risks have decreased since Syrian Golan became more stable in 2018, rocket attacks and sporadic gunfire have occurred in northern Israel without warning since 2012. There is also a risk of falling debris from Israeli and Syrian air-defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Land mines have also been planted in lots of places across the Occupied Golan Heights, including near to populated areas and roads. These areas are usually marked, and are often fenced off. Follow established roads and paths, and do not hike off trail. If you are travelling in the region, follow advice from local law enforcement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-lebanon\">Border with Lebanon</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 5km of the border with Lebanon. The Israeli military have announced that the area is a closed military zone and entry into the area is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the Sheba\u2019a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the \u2018Blue Line\u2019) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town. If travelling near areas of military operation, adhere to all Israeli official instructions.</p>\n\n<p>The situation on the ground could change quickly. On 7 April 2023, Israel carried out strikes against targets in southern Lebanon in response to rockets launched on 6 April 2023 from southern Lebanon into Israel. On 20 July 2020 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line. You should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-egypt\">Border with Egypt</h3>\n\n<p>The security situation on the border with Egypt remains volatile. Take extra care and be vigilant when using Route 10 which runs along the Israeli border with Egypt and is subject to closures by the Israeli authorities. You may wish to consider using other routes.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent clashes between Israeli Security Forces and Palestinians in these areas and violent incidents can occur without warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"west-bank\">West Bank</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. There has been a heightened state of tension and violent clashes resulting in deaths in the West Bank since the outbreak of conflict on 7 October. .</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0There are road closures and numerous checkpoints across the West Bank. Travel in and out of the West Bank is not possible without passing through at least one Israeli military checkpoint. You will need a passport and immigration slip to go through these checkpoints. Checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. Please refer to the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Access Coordination Unit</a>\u00a0for information (which is subject to change).</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities sometimes restrict movement in and out of the West Bank, either on Jewish High Holidays, Israeli national holidays or as a result of a security incident. This doesn\u2019t normally affect foreign nationals, but would affect dual Palestinian-British nationals. Road closures can occur with little notice. Keep up to date with local travel updates.</p>\n\n<p>The cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho see large numbers of tourists including on organised tours and there have been no recent reports of any serious incidents involving foreigners. However, take care when travelling anywhere in the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers. Check the local news before travelling to see if there have been recent clashes and avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have occurred in Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, at Israeli checkpoints, around Palestinian refugee camps and along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis. Be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. Check the local news in advance and avoid travelling to areas which have been the site of recent violence. Exercise extreme caution when driving on these routes, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>Israelis living in the illegal settlements in the West Bank occasionally organise demonstrations in the West Bank which sometimes turn violent. There are also a number of reports of settlers threatening those travelling near to settlements and settlement outposts. Take particular care if you are near settlements, including those in the hills around Nablus and in the South Hebron hills and settlement outposts (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). There is a closed military zone in the H2 area of Hebron (around Ash-Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs), where there is a risk of a hostile reaction from members of extremist groups.</p>\n\n<p>Due to a significant number of road traffic accidents involving taxis in the West Bank, you\u2019re advised not to use them where possible. Avoid using buses on the West Bank and keep in mind the difficulties and risks associated with travelling between Jerusalem/Ramallah via checkpoints and the risks associated with travelling along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on travel, the ability of the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0to provide consular assistance in the West Bank may be limited. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recommends all British nationals in Israel and the OPTs register their presence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are trouble-free, but the theft of passports, credit cards, and valuables from public beaches is common. Keep your personal belongings in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Crime is generally not a problem in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, but you should take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-security\">Passport security</h2>\n<p>A Serious Organised Crime Agency investigation into the misuse of UK passports in the murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in Dubai in January 2010 found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports. This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. Only hand your passport over to others (including Israeli officials) when absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is erratic, maintenance of public buses is variable, and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on roads within Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, and fines for speeding are high.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in the West Bank, check that you are insured before setting out. It may be easier to arrange West Bank insurance at a hire company in East Jerusalem than from the major hire car companies in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It is not safe to hitchhike in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to the desert, go with others, take a supply of water and a mobile phone, and let someone know your itinerary and expected time of return.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 355 road deaths in the Israel (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 3.9 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Our advice against all travel to the West Bank does not apply to Route 1 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</p>\n\n",

Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are ongoing Israeli air strikes into Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are very likely to continue with an increased threat of attacks, including by individuals acting alone.</p>\n\n<p>Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Old City in Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>government, military and police installations</li>\n  <li>security personnel including military and police</li>\n  <li>transport networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with Western interests</li>\n  <li>crowded places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of recent significant attacks include:</p>\n\n<p>In 2023:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 people were killed and one\u00a0 injured during a shooting attack in the Jordan Valley</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 6 people\u00a0 injured during a car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 3 people injured in a shooting attack in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>7 people were killed and 3 injured during a shooting attack in Neve Yaakov, East Jerusalem</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2022:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 people were killed and 22 people injured during 2 explosions in West Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>3 people were killed and 4 injured during a stabbing attack</li>\n  <li>2 Israelis were killed and 10 injured during a shooting attack in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>5 Israelis were killed in a terrorist shooting incident in Bne Brak</li>\n  <li>2 Israelis were killed and 4 injured in a terrorist shooting incident in Hadera</li>\n  <li>4 people were killed and 2 others injured in a ramming and stabbing incident in Ber Sheva</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnap is a risk in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. There is a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza and Hamas has reportedly taken hostages across the border and into the Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

You can find locations of ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and towns in travel guides and online.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid driving into ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of Jerusalem on Shabbat (from sunset on Friday to nightfall (approximately 1 hour after sunset) on Saturday). If you attempt to drive into these areas local residents may throw stones at your car.</p>\n\n<p>During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset is forbidden for Muslims (though not for children under the age of 8). Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, you should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places in the Occupied Palestinian Territories during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year, you can look them up online. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<p>Be sensitive about taking pictures of people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. Don\u2019t take photographs of military or police personnel or installations.</p>\n\n<p>Carry identification with you at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details and entry stamp pages of your passport).</p>\n\n<p>The penalties for smuggling and trafficking in illegal drugs are severe. Those caught in possession can expect a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10 year prison sentence. Attitudes towards LGBT issues within some parts of Palestinian and Israeli society can be hostile. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention on the West Bank in more conservative Israeli areas, including ultra-Orthodox communities. Homosexuality is largely taboo in Palestinian society.</p>\n\n<p>Some Palestinian groups may violently oppose events, cultural events and demonstrations, which they consider to be inconsistent with their own values. This includes those perceived to be linked to the LGBT+ community, even if the event is not intended to promote LGBT+ rights. In these cases, the Palestinian security forces and police may not always act effectively to protect participants. You should be aware of these risks. You should liaise with the local authorities before planning or organising any event.</p>\n\n<p>Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT community and is famous for its annual Pride Parade. An annual Pride Parade is also held in Jerusalem, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing occurred during the 2015 parade. You should exercise extra vigilance if attending. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Israel is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you are caught breaking local laws on import and export of wild animals you can expect to receive a substantial fine and up to 2 years in prison.

If you\u2019re unsure how Israel and The Occupied Palestinian Territories\u2019 entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported. This process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country\u2019s immigration policy or procedures.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you\u2019re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.</p>\n\n<p>At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states \u2018Palestinian Authority only\u2019 or \u2018Judea and Samaria only\u2019. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2017, the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Contact the Israeli embassy</a> if you need further information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-other-countries\">Previous Travel to Other Countries</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a> prior to arrival.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-and-immigration\">Customs and Immigration</h3>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. You may experience lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Searches and questioning may be longer in some cases, including but not limited to some visitors with Palestinian or Arab ancestry with evidence of previous travel which may be considered suspicious, or those who are considered to have publicly criticised the state of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Airside Immigration officials occasionally ask travellers to wait whilst further checks are conducted. This is not routine procedure, but a small number of travellers do experience delays, some for several hours. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can legally be refused entry if they have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or if they belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refusal-of-entry-into-israel\">Refusal of entry into Israel</h3>\n\n<p>If in the rare event you are refused entry to Israel you will be booked on the next available flight back to the port from which you entered Israel and on the same airline. Depending on the flight schedule you may be taken to the Immigration Detention Centre located a few minutes\u2019 drive from the airport. You will remain there until your flight departs. Whilst there you will have access to a telephone, information in English, and medical assistance if required. Your luggage will remain at the airport so you will need to highlight to officials if you need to retrieve anything urgent from your luggage, for example medication. The Embassy is contactable from the Detention Centre and can assist where possible. But the Embassy cannot intervene with immigration decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h3>\n\n<p>Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and Israeli immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs.</p>\n\n<p>On 20 October 2022, the Government of Israel introduced new requirements for foreign nationals entering and residing in the West Bank. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/departments/policies/judeaentry2022\">You can find more information on the requirements and points of contact for enquiries via the Israeli government website.</a></p>\n\n<p>Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that they are not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. This is unless they obtain advance authorisation from the Israeli \u2018Territory Actions Co-ordinator\u2019, violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>You may be detained on arrival to Israel and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you are entering Israel for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. If you decide to visit Gaza against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you will need to contact the relevant authorities well in advance. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is no longer able to provide administrative support for UK charities wishing to enter Gaza via the Rafah crossing. The Rafah border regularly closes with no warning and for long periods of time. The Erez border also sometimes closes with no warning. At these times it may be impossible to enter or leave Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Please refer to this website for information</a> (which is subject to change). For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"british-nationals-of-palestinian-origin\">British nationals of Palestinian origin</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a British national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave Gaza or the West Bank. If you are a British national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of British nationals of Palestinian origin or British nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h3>\n\n<p>British-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Allenby and Rafah border crossings (respectively) with Jordan and Egypt and return via the same route. Please note: British/Palestinian dual nationals entering Gaza, which is against our Travel Advice, should check with the relevant authorities on entry/exit procedures. Numbers of such dual nationals permitted to enter and exit Gaza via Erez are very limited and include medical, humanitarian cases and aid workers. The final decision on entry and exit permits via Erez always rests with the Israeli authorities</p>\n\n<p>If you are a dual national check with your nearest Israeli Embassy if pre-approval is required for travel to Israel. Dual nationals holding Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, and Lebanese citizenship have previously been impacted. If you are not a citizen of any of these countries, but have close family ties, it is also advisable to check with your nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<p>Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19\">COVID-19</h2>\n\n<p>Entry requirements for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://corona.health.gov.il/en/abroad/\">the Ministry of Health</a> pages for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"children-and-young-people\">Children and young people</h2>\n\n<p>Minors (aged 17  years and under) travelling to Israel alone or with only one parent are advised to carry with them a letter from their parents or guardians confirming their approval, accommodation plans and contact details.</p>\n\n<p>Minors exiting Israel alone should carry a locally issued notarised letter as advised by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://lawoffice.org.il/en/unaccompanied-minors-traveling-abroad-from-israel/\">external firms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See \u2018Dual nationals\u2019 section above concerning children with Israeli parents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entry-via-land-borders\">Entry via Land Borders</h2>\n\n<p>You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/leaving-israel/#sea-and-land\">Israeli Ministry of Health\u2019s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those wishing to enter Jordan from Israel will need to register in advance.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-medical-care\">Local medical care</h3>\n<p>Healthcare in Israel is not free and medical treatment can be expensive. Hospitals will insist on payment and may take legal action to delay departure until bills are met. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 101 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.\u00a0</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund.

Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners, such as:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>diplomatic premises</li>\n  <li>conference centres</li>\n  <li>locations popular with tourists and foreigners</li>\n  <li>sporting and cultural events</li>\n  <li>shopping centres</li>\n  <li>transport hubs</li>\n  <li>religious sites and places of worship, particularly churches</li>\n  <li>national parks and nature reserves; including the Parc du W</li>\n  <li>foreign, national or local government buildings</li>\n  <li>large crowds</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, monitor announcements and local media, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillab\u00e9ri regions. Notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 2 October 2023, terrorists killed around 30 soldiers in Takanamat, Tahoua</li>\n  <li>on 30 September 2023, terrorists killed 33 soldiers in Imbalagan, Tillaberi</li>\n  <li>on 16 August 2023, terrorists killed 30 civilians in the Kandadji region, Tillaberi</li>\n  <li>on 1 February 2023, terrorists killed 18 people in an attack on a refugee camp in Tillia, Tahoua</li>\n  <li>in 2022, an IED explosion took place in Bougoum (approximately 5km from Niamey city limits) killing 2 civilians</li>\n  <li>in 2022, a Gendarme Post in Bougoum was attacked by armed individuals on motorbikes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), who operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso; and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram who operate in the Lake Chad Basin. Criminal groups also carry out kidnaps.</p>\n\n<p>Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In October 2020 an American was kidnapped (and rescued shortly after) in Massalata near the border with Nigeria. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125km south-west of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillab\u00e9ri region of Niger in April 2018.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling. You should be particularly vigilant when walking (in Niamey, you should not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time), in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, night clubs, restaurants, nature reserves and national parks, and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.</p>\n\n<p>These protests may be violent and the security situation could change quickly without warning.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 July, the Conseil\u00a0National\u00a0pour la Sauvegarde de la Patrie (CNSP) launched a military coup which has led to protests and unrest.</p>\n\n<p>The President of Niger, His Excellency Mohamed Bazoum of the PNDS political party, has been detained since 26 July.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and can be violent. If you become aware of any protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the area immediately, as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe.</p>\n\n<p>The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit March\u00e9 in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings. Avoid walking alone there, and do not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time. Be vigilant when walking anywhere in the city. Walking at night is more dangerous as there\u2019s a lack of street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks on people, including westerners, as they are leaving banks and ATMs. Be careful when using ATMs on the street, never do this at night-time, and if possible use the ATMs available in most large hotels.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Car thieves often target 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas (particularly Maradi, Tillab\u00e9ri and Diffa). You should take special care and avoid crossing borders after dark.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been hold-ups and robberies on public buses between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit. In some cases people have been killed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by internet and other scams. The scams come in many forms \u2013 romance and friendship, business ventures, or work and employment opportunities. Victims are at great financial risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Niger is a Muslim country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Be aware of your actions and dress in case they offend, especially during the month of Ramadan or if you visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you commit a crime you will be subject to local law. Local prison conditions are harsh.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You should carry identification at all times. This would normally be your passport or residence permit. If you drive outside the main towns, authorities are very likely to ask you to produce identification.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024 Ramadan in Niger is expected to be from 11 March to 9 April. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not photograph military or government installations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There is no law criminalising same-sex sexual activity in Niger. However, there are laws under the Penal Code of 1993 covering \u2018public outrage against modesty\u2019 and \u2018immodest or unnatural acts\u2019. An \u2018unnatural act\u2019 with a person of the same sex who is under the age of 21 can be punishable by a fine of up to 100,000 francs and up to 3 years imprisonment. Although we are not aware of any prosecutions under this legislation, attitudes within society towards LGBT+ people can be discriminatory.</p>\n\n<p>There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and no legal recognition of same-sex couples.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> continues to advise against all travel to Niger.\u00a0Travel within or out of Niger is\u00a0at your own risk. The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Niger.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Niger, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Niger using a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (<abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer than 3 months, you will need to get a Nigerien licence.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your UK driving licence and car registration documents with you at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n\n<p>The main roads between Niamey and other large towns are generally satisfactory by African standards, but some roads are pot-holed, conditions are often worse during and just after rainy season. Driving standards are poor. Vehicles often drive without lights at night and there is little street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. Avoid travelling between towns at night.</p>\n\n<p>Aim to use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and give details of your itinerary to the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone. Make sure you have a supply of drinking water and food.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of landmines being used in Burkina Faso on the road between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Seek local advice before making this journey.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of an accident, you should go immediately to the nearest police station to file a report. Crowds can gather quickly and you may be vulnerable if you remain at the scene. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid using buses or taxis where possible.</p>\n\n<p>Buses operate on routes between Niamey and other large towns, but distances are long and buses are prone to mechanical failure. There have also been hold-ups and robberies on public buses. See \u2018Crime\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are available, but are often in poor mechanical condition. Driving standards are poor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Air space has now re-opened, although flight options may be more limited and could change at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for the latest information.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Flights within Niger remain limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weatherand-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather\u00a0and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"floods-and-landslides\">Floods and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Niger is from June to October.

Attacks against tourists are known to take place at El Meki between Agadez and Timia. The A\u00efr and T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 regions are particularly prone to attacks.</p>\n\n<p>An official curfew has been implemented by the authorities in the whole of the Diffa region since 2014. Since 2019 this has prohibited the movement of motorised vehicles from 8pm to 6am. There is also a general curfew from 10pm to 6am.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"western-niger\">Western Niger</h2>\n\n<p>A state of emergency has been in place in the urban municipality of Tillab\u00e9ri since 2019. The movement of motorbikes and cars is banned from 7pm to 6am, and the movement of pedestrians is banned from 10pm to 6am. Public meetings are banned, unless expressly permitted by the authorities. Defence and security forces are authorised to carry out searches, and to check IDs, both day and night.</p>\n\n<p>Following an attack in 2020 which killed 6 French nationals and 2 Nigeriens in Kour\u00e9, Tillab\u00e9ri, a state of emergency is in place for the whole of Tillab\u00e9ri apart from Niamey.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency has also been in place in Ouallam, Ayorou, Bankilare, Abala and Banibongou (Tillab\u00e9ri region) and Tassara and Tillia (Tahoua region) since 2017.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"southern-niger\">Southern Niger</h2>\n\n<p>A state of emergency is in place in the states of Borno and Yobe in Nigeria, which border Niger.

Citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists may target places visited by foreigners, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>public buildings</li>\n  <li>places of worship</li>\n  <li>major events</li>\n  <li>large public gatherings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks around religious occasions and public holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Previous attacks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>armed assaults</li>\n  <li>suicide bombings</li>\n  <li>car bombings</li>\n  <li>rocket attacks</li>\n  <li>arson</li>\n  <li>improvised explosive devices left in bins, crowded areas, shops and on public transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is also a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local security authorities</li>\n  <li>monitor media reports</li>\n  <li>cooperate fully with security officials at airports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey. Organisations such as the YPG and the G\u00fclen Movement are illegal in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist and insurgent groups include Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), PKK, and THKP/C-Acilciler (Turkish People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front) and the DHKP/C (Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Front). There\u2019s a domestic terrorist presence in the southeast of the country including in Van, Bitlis, Bingol, Elazig, Mus, Batman, Erzincan, Diyarbakir and Agri provinces.</p>\n\n<p>DHKP/C attacks have mainly targeted the Turkish authorities and US diplomatic missions.</p>\n\n<p>Extremist groups based in Syria including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups have the capacity to carry out attacks in neighbouring countries, including Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care during dates of significance to terrorist groups, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>15 August</li>\n  <li>30 March to 20 April</li>\n  <li>19 December</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria, including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups, routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. They\u2019re present in the Syrian border areas. Be particularly vigilant in these locations. Daesh and other terrorist groups may target humanitarian aid workers and journalists. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Occasional demonstrations can occur in cities and may become violent. Police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and demonstrations are ongoing in locations across Turkey. Large demonstrations have been reported outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in major cities, particularly Israeli diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-robbery-and-pickpocketing\">Street robbery and pickpocketing</h3>\n\n<p>Street robbery and pick-pocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. Be aware of your personal belongings and make sure they are always secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them so they are not spiked. Be wary of strangers approaching you offering food and drink (which may be drugged), to change money, or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"counterfeit-alcohol\">Counterfeit alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>In a small number of cases, counterfeit alcohol has caused deaths of tourists. If you have any concerns, seek advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>In 2022, 51 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most sexual assault cases reported to British consular staff in Turkey have happened during summer holidays in coastal tourist areas. Many were committed at night by someone the victim met during the day, including hotel workers. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. Be extra vigilant in these situations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-safety\">Vehicle safety</h3>\n\n<p>Accepting lifts from strangers can be dangerous. Find a registered taxi and note the registration number before entering.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal not to carry some form of photographic ID in Turkey. Always carry your passport or residence permit. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the authorities may stop people for ID checks. There are also several police checkpoints on main roads across Turkey. Cooperate with officials conducting checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-visiting-mosques\">Dress visiting mosques</h3>\n\n<p>Dress modestly if you\u2019re visiting a mosque or a religious shrine to avoid causing offence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-injury-claims\">Personal injury claims</h3>\n\n<p>There are reports of tourists being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness in Turkey. Find out what you can do if you have suffered a personal injury on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/legal-system/personal-injury/personal-injuries/\">Citizens Advice website</a>. Only make a claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-bans\">Smoking bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is illegal on public transport and in all indoor workplaces and public places. Smoking is restricted in some outdoor areas where cultural, artistic, sports or entertainment activities are held.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Turkey has strict laws against the use, possession and trafficking of illegal drugs. You may receive a fine or prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stray-dogs\">Stray dogs</h3>\n\n<p>Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care and do not approach stray dogs. If you\u2019re bitten, get medical advice immediately. Rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Turkey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sale-of-antiquities\">Sale of antiquities</h3>\n\n<p>The possession, sale and export of antiquities is illegal. You could be fined and receive a prison sentence of 5 to 12 years. Some historical items found at local markets and in antique shops can be sold within Turkey but are illegal to export. Confirm the legal requirements before purchasing or exporting such items.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras\">Using cameras</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs near military or official installations. Ask for permission before photographing people.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is legal in Turkey. However, many parts of Turkey are socially conservative and showing affection in public could result in unwelcome attention. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"comments-about-the-nation-and-flag\">Comments about the nation and flag</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to insult the Turkish nation or the national flag, or to deface currency. This can include comments about the Turkish state. These laws also apply to comments made online. You could get a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"extreme-sports\">Extreme sports</h3>\n\n<p>If you do an extreme sport, check that adequate safety precautions are in place. British nationals have been injured and killed doing extreme sports. Only use reputable operators. Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all activities you want to do.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Turkey, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>. You must carry a green card in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by road, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between major cities are generally in excellent condition, but can be poor in remote, rural areas. Accidents are common and mainly due to poor or reckless driving.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal not to wear a helmet on motorcycles and mopeds. You may get a large fine if you do not wear a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Do not drink and drive. The police fine drunk drivers and your licence could be confiscated for 6 months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK driving licence (notarised in Turkish)\u00a0to drive in Turkey. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay in Turkey for more than 6 months, you must convert your UK driving licence into a Turkish licence. Provisional driving licences aren\u2019t recognised. If you intend to bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey, familiarise yourself with the relevant Turkish customs regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires happen frequently in Turkey during summer. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas.</p>\n\n<p>You could get a fine or prison sentence for lighting a fire of any kind in forbidden areas. This includes barbeques and discarding cigarette butts in the woods.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a forest fire in your area, local authorities may tell you to leave your accommodation. Follow the directions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a forest fire, call emergency services on 112.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged, making it difficult to travel and reducing essential services.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in an affected area:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Many parts of Turkey regularly experience earthquakes and tremors. These can be a high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure, and pose a risk to life.</p>\n\n<p>A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey in February 2023.  Strong earthquakes may continue to affect the region and it remains heavily damaged.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any advice given by the local authorities. \u00a0See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">before, during and after an earthquake</a> .</p>\n\n",

The Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office now advises against all but essential travel to the city of Acapulco.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Otis caused significant damage to infrastructure in Acapulco and along Mexico\u2019s southern coast between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado, including hotels, transport, communications, and health services. There have been reports of looting and robbery, given the scarce supplies of food, water and fuel. The National Guard have deployed to the region to help with disaster efforts.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the advice of local authorities, including the National Guard. The Mexican <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/CNPC_MX\">civil protection secretariat</a>\u00a0offers local disaster advice, including hurricane shelter\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://acapulco.gob.mx/refugios-temporales/\">locations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The 95D Federal Toll Road (Autopista Del Sol) has now reopened, but roads in the region have been subject to flooding, mudslides and traffic accidents. The Mexican Government are offering busses to Mexico City for affected tourists. For more information, stay in touch with your accommodation provider and monitor communications from local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Zihuatenejo airport is open. As of 27 October, Acapulco airport re-opened, but only for flights transporting stranded tourists back to Mexico City. Normal commercial flights are still not operating. You can find more information on the status of airports on the OMA\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OMAeropuertos\">account</a>. For further information on tourist evacuations, follow the Mexican Government SICT <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SICTmx\">account</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/VivaAerobus\">VivaAerobus</a> .</p>\n\n<p>The post-storm situation remains dangerous in Acapulco and the wider state of Guerrero. There may be further flash flooding and mudslides. Be aware that historically more accidents occur post-storm than during it. The storm is not the only hazard; many electric lines may be down and some buildings may not be structurally sound. See the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>\u00a0for further advice about how to prepare for travel during hurricane season, what to do ahead of a storm and what to expect in the aftermath of a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/safety-and-security#hurricanes\">Hurricanes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For 24/7 help for affected British people, you can call +52 55 1670 3200. If you are in need of urgent assistance, please stay on the line and select option 1 for English, and then 4 to speak to an officer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"before-you-travel\">Before you travel</h2>\n\n<p>No travel can be guaranteed safe.

Customs officials at the border should be able to tell you where to find the immigration office \u2013 it\u2019s usually close to the border.

These can be tense and confrontational and could potentially turn violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. Monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities in Mexico. Participation in demonstrations may result in detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<p>Politically motivated violence can happen across the country and has recently increased. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations. If you come across protests, move away from the area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime in Mexico can pose a risk for foreigners, particularly in major cities and tourist resort areas where street crime is a serious issue.</p>\n\n<p>Many Mexican and foreign businesses choose to hire private security. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>research your destination thoroughly</li>\n  <li>only travel during daylight hours when possible</li>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>inform trusted contacts of your travel plans</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of a crime and want to report the incident, do so immediately to the nearest branch of the state prosecutor\u2019s office (\u2018Agencia del Ministerio P\u00fablico\u2019). A criminal investigation is not possible without a formal complaint to Mexican authorities. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.caepccm.df.gob.mx/\">Mexico City Command and Control Centre</a> (\u2018Centro de Atenci\u00f3n a Emergencias y Proteci\u00f3n Ciudadana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\u2019)  has information and advice in Spanish on safety in Mexico City.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-atms\">Using ATMs</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs or exchanging money at an exchange shop (bureau de change). It\u2019s generally safer to use ATMs during daylight hours and inside shops or malls. People withdrawing money from airport money exchange shops and ATMs in various locations have later been targeted by criminals.\u00a0 Avoid withdrawing large amounts of money and be careful of your surroundings and who is around you while you are using the ATM.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing is common on the Mexico City Metro.  Avoid wearing expensive clothing, jewellery or watches. Limit the amount of cash or credit/debit cards you carry with you. Watch your briefcases and luggage, even in apparently secure places like the lobby of your hotel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of people presenting themselves as police officers trying to fine or arrest you for no reason, travellers driving rental cars have been targeted. Some police officers have extorted money from tourists, for alleged minor offences or traffic violations. If this happens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not hand over money or your passport</li>\n  <li>ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable later.</li>\n  <li>ask for identification</li>\n  <li>try to take note of the officer\u2019s name, badge number, and patrol car number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminals may attempt to contact your friends or relatives to transfer money to Mexico, this can occur following cases of phone theft or hacking, arrange with relatives and friends how you will contact them or how you would arrange to transfer money in advance.</p>\n\n<p>A common scam involves criminals phoning, acting as a distressed member of family, or an employee, claiming to be kidnapped and demanding money for their release. Thieves may also claim that a relative is being detained. If you are threatened over the phone, hang up and check on the safety of your family member or employee.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants. Travellers have been robbed or assaulted after being drugged. Tainted alcohol has caused illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Several sexual offences have happened in tourist areas outside of Mexico City. Take care even in areas close to hotels, and especially after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called \u2018express kidnapping\u2019) can happen, particularly in urban areas. Victims are forced to withdraw money from credit or debit cards at a cash point to secure their release.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term kidnapping for financial gain also happens, and there have been allegations of police officers being involved. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where you may be overheard by others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violence\">Violence</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Drug-related violence in Mexico has increased over recent years. Penalties for drug offences are severe, convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<p>Some areas of Mexico have a high crime rate due to the fighting between rival organised crime gangs. In these areas, there is a risk of being caught in the crossfire or of being mistaken for a member of a rival gang. Whilst risks are lower in tourist areas, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take advice    from local authorities or your hotel</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings at all times</li>\n  <li>use reputable tourism or transport companies</li>\n  <li>travel during the daytime where possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Stay away from isolated roads and use toll roads (\u2018cuotas\u2019) whenever possible. Keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights.</p>\n\n<p>Violent car-jackings and robberies happen along the Pacific Highway, if you suspect you\u2019re being followed or watched, drive to a police station or other safe place. Targets have included large camper vans or sports utility vehicles (SUVs).</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of criminals deliberately causing traffic accidents in order to make insurance claims or request cash from the other party. They are sometimes accompanied by threats of violence or intimidation. Contact the authorities for support where necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert on public transport, at airports and in bus stations. Theft on buses is common, so always keep your belongings safe.</p>\n\n<p>Buses have also been hijacked. Try to travel on first-class buses using toll roads, which have a lower rate of incidents than second and third-class buses travelling on the less secure free (\u2018libre\u2019) roads. Most first-class bus companies perform security checks when passengers board the bus.</p>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone on public transport have been targeted with harassment, robbery and sexual assault.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>If you require information on procedures, local laws, development of current events or social services you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mexicocity.cdmx.gob.mx/e/about/about-locatel/#:~:text=LOCATEL%20is%20the%20Mexico%20City,and%20institutions%20of%20Mexico%20City.\">contact Mexico City\u2019s public telephone service LOCATEL</a> on 5658 1111. They have English-speaking staff available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>If requested by Mexican authorities, you will need to provide your passport and stamp to prove your entrance and stay, copies and photos are not accepted. To demonstrate your visa status, you can get a digital registry of your entry documents from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inm.gob.mx/spublic/portal/inmex.html\">Portal de Servicios INM</a>. If you are unable to produce these documents, you may be questioned by Immigration officers and held in a detention centre while the authorities check your immigration status. Depending on the outcome, you can be deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-status\">Legal status</h3>\n\n<p>The Mexican Police have the authority to ask for proof of legal status in Mexico at any time. Several British people have been detained for not having the relevant documentation on them. If you are a resident, you may be asked to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to bring electronic cigarettes, vaping devices and solutions into Mexico or to buy and sell them. If found in your belongings by customs officials, these will be confiscated; resulting in being fined or being detained.</p>\n\n<p>You can be fined up to \u00a3150 for smoking or vaping in public places.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe and convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relations in Mexico are generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Civil unions between same-sex partners are legal in Mexico.    Public displays of affection between same-sex couples may be frowned upon. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>Assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, is only legally recognised in some Mexican states. If you\u2019re considering a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico, familiarise yourself with the relevant laws and regulations and make sure you meet all legal requirements to take the child out of Mexico before you start the process. Seek independent legal advice before entering into any surrogacy arrangement. For more information <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">see our guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"main-tourist-destinations\">Main tourist destinations</h2>\n\n<p>The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Cancun</li>\n  <li>Cozumel</li>\n  <li>Los Cabos</li>\n  <li>Nuevo Vallarta</li>\n  <li>Playa del Carmen</li>\n  <li>Puerto Vallarta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British travellers have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. On occasion, hotel staff have not been helpful and tried to dissuade victims from pursuing the incident with police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cancun-and-tulum\">Cancun and Tulum</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several clashes between rival criminal gangs in popular tourist destinations in Cancun and surrounding areas.</p>\n\n<p>Two foreign tourists were killed in Tulum, more tourists were injured during a shoot out in Puerto Morelos, and most recently there was a shooting in a hotel in Playa del Carmen in locations popular with tourists. While tourists have not been the target, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected. Since 2021, there have been several cases of tourists being affected by shootings.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise increased caution after dark in downtown areas of Cancun, Tulum, and Playa del Carmen. Remain in well-lit pedestrian streets and tourist zones. If you are visiting any of these areas, monitor local advice, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hotel-safety\">Hotel safety</h2>\n\n<p>In some hotels, balcony balustrades may not be as high as you expect and there could be a risk of falling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>If you take part in adventurous sports (including paragliding, skydiving, scuba diving and jet-skiing), make sure safety precautions are in place. Equipment may not meet UK safety and insurance standards. British nationals have been injured and, in some cases, killed participating in extreme sports.</p>\n\n<p>You should make sure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you only use reputable operators</li>\n  <li>the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features</li>\n  <li>the company are fully licensed and insured</li>\n  <li>you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance for all the activities you want to undertake</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are rare in Mexico, but you should take care particularly when surfing, research the local area and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Crocodiles are present in Mexico, most commonly in lagoons and coastal areas. Sightings have been reported near tourist areas, including Cancun and resorts on the Pacific coast. There are signs warning about crocodiles around many lagoons in these areas. Respect the warnings and do not walk too close to the water. Tourists have been seriously injured in crocodile attacks in the past.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards are very different from the UK. Roads can be pot-holed, and driving conditions can be unpredictable. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lane without indicating and going through red lights. Many local drivers do not have any form of car insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Mexico using a UK license or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you are planning to drive in Mexico, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-restrictions\">Driving restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>To reduce air pollution, Mexico City and some other parts of the country have driving restrictions. Cars may be banned from entering certain areas on particular days, based on their number plates, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/programas/programa/hoy-no-circula\">Check the Hoy no Circula</a> programme for further details.</p>\n\n<p>These regulations are strictly enforced and offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle. Check if this applies with your car hire company.</p>\n\n<p>There is an additional driving restriction in Mexico City, where vehicles without registration plates from the State of Mexico (\u2018Estado de Mexico\u2019) or Mexico City are not allowed to enter Mexico City from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Monday to Friday between 5am and 11am</li>\n  <li>Saturday between 5am and 10pm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If air pollution is high, generally between February and June, further driving restrictions may apply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>In remote areas, you may come across unofficial roadblocks, including on main roads. They are manned by local groups seeking money for an unofficial local toll, they can become violent and deny entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Passengers have been robbed and assaulted by unlicensed taxi drivers including in Mexico City. Use the better regulated \u2018sitio\u2019 taxis from authorised taxi ranks or ask your hotel to order you a taxi.

Armed clashes between security forces and drug groups can happen at any time without warning. Take extreme care outside tourist areas in all of these states.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"baja-california-including-tijuana\">Baja California (including Tijuana)</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tijuana in Baja California, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>airside transit through Tijuana airport</li>\n  <li>the cross border express taken from the airport zone</li>\n  <li>passage through Tijuana to cross the border via the federal toll road 1D and Via R\u00e1pida</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We also advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tecate including the roads 2D and 2 that connects Tijuana and Tecate.</p>\n\n<p>If you are crossing the border by toll road 1D try to do so during daylight, or be very cautious  after dark. Tijuana is an extremely violent city and there is a risk that you may be targeted or caught up in conflicts between rival groups.</p>\n\n<p>Many businesses including shops operate with an unofficial curfew, only opening during day light hours due to the security threat. There are several organised crime groups fighting for control over the city\u2019s drugs trade and trafficking routes. There are high rates of kidnapping, murder and organised crime activity particularly drugs, human and arms trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>Armed attacks and targeted killings happen across the state and violent robberies are a particular issue in the urban centres of Tijuana, Mexicali and Ensenada. Be careful in Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada and Rosarito, there have been several incidents of violent armed crime in these towns, which has targeted stores and bystanders in response to disputes with the government.  Stay on established tourist routes and destinations across the state and be aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez or other cities in Northern States. Travel during daylight hours when possible, inform relatives or friends of your travel plans and use reputable hotels only.</p>\n\n<p>Take precautions in the state of Baja California, including Tijuana. There  is drug-related crime in Baja California Sur, including Los Cabos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"chihuahua\">Chihuahua</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Chihuahua except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the city of Chihuahua</li>\n  <li>the border crossing in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (accessed by federal toll road 45)</li>\n  <li>federal toll road 45D connecting the cities of Chihuahua and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</li>\n  <li>the Copper Canyon rail route to/from Chihuahua and towns immediately on this route including Creel</li>\n  <li>the road from Creel via San Juanito to San Pedro</li>\n  <li>state highway 16 from San Pedro to Chihuahua</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are high levels of organised crime activity, particularly human and drugs trafficking. There is illegal drug cultivation in rural areas of the state, with associated criminal activity.</p>\n\n<p>If visiting the Copper Canyon rail route, do not walk alone in the canyon, or stray from the tourist trail. Complete all your activities within daylight hours. There are many organised crime groups operating in the area and there is a risk you could be caught up in conflicts between rival groups. Organise all activities with a reputable tour company or trusted local guide.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sinaloa\">Sinaloa</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Sinaloa except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the cities of Los Mochis and Mazatl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Road 32 that runs between El Fuerte and Los Mochis</li>\n  <li>the 15D federal toll road that runs the length of the state</li>\n  <li>the Copper Canyon rail route to/from Los Mochis/El Fuerte and the towns immediately on this route</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Armed robbery and vehicle theft has happened in El Fuerte. Avoid driving at night on the route between El Fuerte and Los Mochis.</p>\n\n<p>There are high levels of drug cultivation in rural areas, leading to conflict between organised crime groups fighting for control.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the presence of organised crime, there are high levels of drug-related violence. There are frequent gun battles between government security forces and organised crime groups , including in the city of Culiac\u00e1n, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst tourists are not usually targeted, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or on suspicion of spying for other organised criminal gangs \u2013 particularly if you are off the beaten tourist track.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tamaulipas\">Tamaulipas</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Tamaulipas except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the border crossing at Nuevo Laredo accessed from Monterrey by federal toll road 85D. You should travel during daylight hours</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tamaulipas is dangerous due to the presence of many organised crime groups who fight for control of drug trafficking routes. There is a risk of armed robbery and kidnap.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2023, two foreign tourists were killed after a group were kidnapped at gunpoint in Matamoros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zacatecas\">Zacatecas</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Zacatecas.</p>\n\n<p>The state is extremely dangerous due to battles between organised crime groups for control of drug trafficking routes and rural areas of the state.</p>\n\n<p>There are high levels of drug-related violence, due to the strong presence of organised crime Gun battles between state security forces and organised crime groups are frequent, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"east\">East</h2>\n\n<p>There have been increased security incidents in the states of Tabasco and Veracruz, including the city of Veracruz.

You should organise all activities with a reputable tour company or trusted local guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"west-and-central\">West and Central</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"colima\">Colima</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole state, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the city of Manzanillo reached by sea or by air via Manzanillo-Costalegre International Airport, and direct travel via road 200 from the airport to Manzanillo. Do not travel by other routes to the city of Manzanillo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Colima has high levels of organised crime activity. The criminal organisations fight each other for control over the state, this leads to armed gun battles on the streets of Colima City as well as throughout rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guanajuato\">Guanajuato</h3>\n\n<p>In the state of Guanajuato, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south west of the road 45D. This includes the cities of Celaya and Irapuato as well as the municipalities of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Abasolo</li>\n  <li>Ac\u00e1mbaro</li>\n  <li>Cuer\u00e1maro</li>\n  <li>Huan\u00edmaro</li>\n  <li>Irapuato</li>\n  <li>Jaral del Progreso</li>\n  <li>Manuel Doblado</li>\n  <li>Morole\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>P\u00e9njamo</li>\n  <li>Pueblo Nuevo</li>\n  <li>Purisima del Rinc\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>Romita</li>\n  <li>Salamanca</li>\n  <li>Salvatierra</li>\n  <li>San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>Santiago Maravat\u00edo</li>\n  <li>Silao de la Victoria</li>\n  <li>Uriangato</li>\n  <li>Valle de Santiago</li>\n  <li>Yuriria</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guanajuato is a drug trafficking route. There have been increased security incidents and drug-related violence in the state of Guanajuato. Fuel thefts from plants and pipelines also happen. Organised crime activity is rampant, particularly in the south of the state. Shootouts are of particular concern in the state of Guanajuato as they can happen in heavily transited places with bystanders frequently being caught in the crossfire.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guerrero-including-acapulco\">Guerrero (including Acapulco)</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all travel to the State of Guerrero except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the town of Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa accessed by air</li>\n  <li>the town of Taxco accessed by the 95D and 200D federal toll roads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guerrero is a violent state with a history of insecurity. There is an organised crime presence throughout the state, including in central Acapulco and Chilpancingo. There have been several instances of armed crime, including shootings and executions, both within and outside the tourist areas in Acapulco and other areas of the state.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, normal work by local authorities to reduce the risks to tourists in the touristic zone in Acapulco has stopped while authorities focus on recovery efforts. There are reports of an increase in crime, robbery and looting across the city, including in previously designated tourist areas. You should take extreme care if travelling to Acapulco.</p>\n\n<p>There are many illegal roadblocks where local crime groups take control of toll booths. If you come across these, you will need to have cash to pay the fee to pass through the booth. If you\u2019re driving in Guerrero, avoid travel after dark and use toll roads where possible, although you may still experience disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>The interior of the state is dangerous. The organised crime groups and local \u2018self-defence\u2019 organisations often have control. Foreigners\u2019 presence in rural Guerrero is likely to be  seen as suspicious by organised crime and local \u2018self-defence\u2019 groups, and the possibility of misunderstanding and resulting in violence is high. There have been cases of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in the state.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"jalisco\">Jalisco</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south and southwest of Lake Chapala to the border state of Colima.

The rural terrain of much of the state makes it difficult for state security forces to respond to incidents.</p>\n\n<p>There are several illegal roadblocks and checkpoints on the roads in this region. These tend to be run by local crime groups attempting to control who is entering and leaving. The Michoac\u00e1n state government itself recommends foreign nationals to avoid this region.</p>\n\n<p>Outsiders travelling in these regions are likely to attract the attention of organised crime groups, who will treat them with suspicion and as possible informants for either other criminal groups or state security, outsiders may be harmed or killed if suspected of being an informant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"centre\">Centre</h2>\n\n<p>Criminal activity is a problem in the state of Mexico (\u2018Estado de M\u00e9xico\u2019).

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"mozambique-border\">Mozambique border</h3>\n\n<p>You should take particular care near the border between Tanzania and the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique. This is due to the risk of attacks by groups linked to Islamic extremism creating cross-border tensions and instability, including a risk of violence. An attack on Kitaya village in October 2020 was claimed by groups linked to Islamic extremism operating from northern Mozambique.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Although most visits to Tanzania are trouble-free, violent and armed crime exists. The British High Commission continues to receive regular reports of British nationals who are the victims of mugging and bag snatching (especially by passing cars or motorbikes) and armed robbery and burglary have increased throughout the country. In December 2016, a European family was robbed at gun point and their campsite guard killed at South Beach, 20km southeast of Dar es Salaam. In Dar es Salaam, tourists have been kidnapped, assaulted, robbed and forced with the threat of violence to withdraw cash from ATMs and arrange cash transfers of up to \u00a35,000 through Western Union after being befriended by strangers or using unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Do not accept lifts from strangers or individuals offering to procure a licensed taxi on your behalf. Do not use unlicensed taxis. Where possible, you should arrange a taxi through a reputable establishment, for example a hotel, and you should always ask to see the driver\u2019s ID. App-based taxi services are not reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Walk as far away from the road as possible and avoid walking and cycling at night. If you need to walk alongside the road, walk towards the traffic. Avoid walking and exercising alone, particularly in isolated areas and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or other valuables including expensive jewellery or watches. Leave your passport in the hotel safe and carry a photocopy for ID at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re attacked, do not resist. If you carry a bag, it is safer to hold it loosely by the handle or hanging off your shoulder rather than by securing the strap across your chest. Bag thieves have targeted both pedestrians and cyclists.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care in places frequented by tourists and expatriate residents. In Dar es Salaam, tourists and residents have been targeted in the city centre, at Ubungo bus station, the Masaki/Oysterbay peninsula area, particularly at Coco Beach and along Toure Drive. On Zanzibar incidents have taken place in Stone Town and at hotels and on popular tourist beaches throughout the island.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure residential property is secure and lock all doors and windows, especially at night. Your security guard should insist on official identification before allowing anyone to enter your property or compound. If in doubt, do not let them in and raise the alarm.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to contact the emergency services, dial 112 and ask for the emergency service you require.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road Safety</h3>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor and driving standards are extremely poor. Road accidents resulting in death and serious injury are common. Drivers and road users frequently drive dangerously and ignore the rules of the road.</p>\n\n<p>Self-driving in Tanzania can be challenging. Check the speed limits before you drive.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant of other road users at all times and drive with caution. Vehicles and motorcycles may try to undertake and overtake in any lane on the roads, including on the hard shoulder of highways. Be wary that drivers of all vehicles often make manoeuvres without signalling beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front of you and do not approach junctions or roundabouts at speed. You should give way to the right at roundabouts, but be careful as drivers often ignore the rules.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by car, always wear a seatbelt. If you have concerns about the roadworthiness or safety of any car, then you should not travel in it.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of car hire companies is variable. Consider using reputable taxis as an alternative. There are no roadside rescue or breakdown services. Road maps are hard to come by and not always up to date. Service stations are infrequent and may not have supplies of fuel.</p>\n\n<p>Road surfaces are variable and many roads are in need of repair, including in major towns and cities. During the rainy seasons, roads may become flooded and road surfaces can deteriorate. Take extra care if you\u2019re driving during the rainy season and seek local advice before making a long car journey. You can find more information on the rainy season in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tanzania/natural-disasters\">\u2018Natural disasters\u2019</a> section .</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions in Tanzania\u2019s national parks can be unpredictable as the roads around the parks, mainly dirt tracks, are generally poor and can become hazardous or impassable after heavy rain. A 4x4 vehicle is often required. Avoid driving out of major towns and cities at night.</p>\n\n<p>Keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, as vehicles are sometimes targeted by thieves. Be particularly careful at night when there is a higher incidence of crime and drunk driving. Avoid driving out of town at night. If you become aware of an unusual incident, or if somebody in plain clothes tries to flag you down, it is often safer not to stop.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent police road blocks. If you\u2019re stopped by the police, ask to see identification before making any payments for traffic violations. If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, co-operate with the local police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-transport\">Local transport</h3>\n\n<p>When making short journeys around towns and cities, you should avoid using local public transport. If you can use an officially licensed taxi as an alternative, you should do so.</p>\n\n<p>Local buses (known as \u2018dala dalas\u2019), motorbike taxis (\u2018boda bodas\u2019), and tuk-tuks (known locally as \u2018bijajis\u2019) do not meet western safety standards. Vehicles are often in poor condition, badly driven, and rarely have proper insurance cover.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent accidents involving dala dalas, boda bodas and tuk tuks, some of which result in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>Pick pockets may operate on overcrowded dala dala buses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>You will need to have an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>\u00a0to drive in Tanzania. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive yourself during a visit to Tanzania, you\u2019ll need your UK licence and an International Driving Permit. To drive in Zanzibar you\u2019ll need your UK licence and a local Zanzibar driving permit (which you can get through your hire car company). Carry several copies of your driving licence, permits and insurance documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Domestic air travel and safari journeys are often undertaken in light, mostly propeller driven, aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Tanzania.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 November 2022, a Precision Air flight from Dar es Salaam to Bukoba crashed into Lake Victoria close to Bukoba airport.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Tanzania is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5H\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel to a neighbouring country or across the region, make sure you check our travel advice for each country you intend to visit.</p>\n\n<p>Information about travel in remote areas can be patchy. Invest in an up-to-date travel guide and only use reliable tour companies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"burundi-borderkigoma-region\">Burundi border/Kigoma region</h3>\n\n<p>Take particular care in the area bordering Burundi/Kigoma region. There have been armed robberies in this area, including vehicle hijackings. Drive only in hours of daylight. There are few facilities for visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"national-parks\">National Parks</h3>\n<p>Careful planning is important to get the best out of your safari. If you choose to camp, only use official sites. Make sure you are properly equipped and seek local advice when travelling to isolated areas. Some parks are extremely remote, and emergency access and evacuation can be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Always follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice, and make sure you have the correct documentation or permit before entering a national park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking\">Trekking</h3>\n<p>If you are trekking or climbing, only use a reputable travel company, stick to established routes and always walk in groups. Make sure you are well prepared and equipped to cope with the terrain and low temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in Tanzania\u2019s northeast, which is home to Mounts Meru and Kilimanjaro. More information and advice about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>In the last few years there have been several ferry disasters in which hundreds of people have died. These were ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, between the islands of Zanzibar and in the Lake Zone area.</p>\n\n<p>Use a reputable ferry company and if you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unseaworthy, do not get on. Familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.</p>\n\n<p>You should also beware of aggressive ticket touts at Tanzanian ports.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://on-shore.mschoa.org/\">designated High Risk  Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"train-travel\">Train travel</h3>\n<p>There have been several accidents on Tanzanian railways. Seek local advice for any long-distance train travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>General elections took place on 28 October 2020. The elections took place largely peacefully. You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies. On occasion, demonstrations and political rallies across Tanzania have turned violent and resulted in fatalities. Police may use tear gas and/or live ammunition for crowd control. Keep up to date with local and international events and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.

Although Tanzania has not suffered a major terrorist incidence since the bombing of the US Embassy in 1998, there have been a number of smaller scale incidents. In October 2020 the village of Kitara in the Mtawa region was attacked. Close to the border with Mozambique, the attack was claimed by Islamic extremists operating in Northern Mozambique. Most attacks target the local security forces, though attacks against Western interests are also possible.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. There is a risk of kidnapping for ransom and political purposes. Places frequented by Westerners, including places of worship, transport hubs, embassies, hotels and restaurants, and major gatherings like sporting and religious events may be targets. Previous attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches are being viewed. You should exercise heightened vigilance at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places, and follow the advice of local authorities. You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.</p>\n\n<p>Extremists linked to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab based in Somalia pose a threat across the East Africa region, and are thought to be active in Tanzania.  Attacks by IS-Mozambique, who are based in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, are possible near Tanzania\u2019s border with this area of Mozambique.  There is also thought to be some support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). The Tanzanian authorities have successfully made a number of arrests in connection to terrorism. However, many incidents in Tanzania are of unclear origin and may be conducted by criminal gangs.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should dress modestly. In Zanzibar and Pemba, women should avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless tops away from tourist resorts, particularly in Stone Town and other places where the local population may be offended.</p>\n\n<p>Zanzibari authorities may fine tourists, guides and tour operators for inappropriate clothing worn in public.

It is illegal for foreigners to take part in any sort of political activity in Nicaragua. You can be arrested and detained or deported for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>taking part in a protest</li>\n  <li>breach of the peace</li>\n  <li>any activity seen as acting against the government, including political meetings and campaigns</li>\n  <li>using Nicaragua\u2019s national flag or colours (blue and white) for campaigning or protesting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Demonstrations can also lead to travel disruption. Check local information before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Foreigners have been affected by violent crime in Nicaragua. Criminals often carry out attacks on people in vehicles. To reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep the windows of your car closed and the doors locked</li>\n  <li>avoid public transport after dark</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take care when walking around markets, bus stations, around the old cathedral in Managua and in the poorer areas of towns. Do not visit these areas after dark on foot.</p>\n\n<p>If you are robbed, do not resist, as many criminals carry weapons. If you report the incident to the police, get a signed and stamped copy of the police report.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is no British Embassy in Nicaragua so we cannot give in-person consular assistance.

You can also withdraw cash in US dollars or Nicaraguan cordobas from ATMs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind.

There\u2019s a risk of drivers failing to give way and driving dangerously, including under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally poor. There is no street lighting on the main highways between major cities and only minimal street lighting in towns. Avoid driving at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a serious or fatal road traffic accident, you\u2019re likely to be detained while it is investigated.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boat-and-ferry-travel\">Boat and ferry travel</h3>\n\n<p>Although local law requires operators of water transport to have insurance, some still do not carry recognised insurance.

You should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>be aware of who is around you when using ATMs\u00a0</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>be vigilant on buses and keep your luggage in view if possible \u2013 thieves are likely to try and distract you\u00a0</li>\n  <li>watch wallets and valuables when on the beach\u00a0</li>\n  <li>avoid leaving luggage in a parked car, either in view or in the boot\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been incidents where thieves slash a tyre and then offer to help change it, while an accomplice steals from the car.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid walking alone in poorly lit or remote areas at night. Gangs occasionally carry out muggings and armed robberies. A number of foreign nationals including one British national have gone missing in recent years, with some incidents related to criminal activity.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re using a hire car, do not stop your car for strangers signalling for help \u2013 they could be carjackers.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Criminals sometimes cause deliberate collisions to stop vehicles and commit robberies or other crimes. If you think a collision was a deliberate act by another driver to make you stop, drive on until you reach a safe place like a police station or garage. You will need to be able to explain your actions to the traffic police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spiked-drinks-and-sexual-assault\">Spiked drinks and sexual assault\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Rapes and sexual assaults have increased, some of which appear targeted toward tourists. Avoid leaving drinks unattended in bars as there have been reports of \u2018spiked\u2019 drinks resulting in assault and theft.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone have reported having to pay extra attention to their personal safety.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methanol-poisoning\">Methanol poisoning\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of deaths and cases of serious illness caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol. Criminal gangs have apparently used methanol in the manufacture of cheap brands of local spirits, including vodka and \u2018guaro\u2019 (cane liquor). You should take care when buying spirit-based drinks.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) says that methanol can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and can seriously damage the optic nerve. Chronic exposure may cause respiratory or cardiac failure. If you, or someone you are travelling with, shows signs of methanol poisoning, seek immediate medical attention.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>As a foreigner, you must carry ID such as a passport. The police will usually accept a photocopy. Make sure you have the original available somewhere safe in case they ask to see it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with drugs of any kind. The Costa Rican authorities treat the possession of drugs and drug trafficking severely. The minimum sentence is 8 years imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica is generally welcoming of LGBT+ travellers. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>While swimming on any beach in Costa Rica, bear in mind that rip currents are very common and there are often no lifeguards. Seek reliable local advice. Drownings are the second most common cause of accidental death and in recent years have averaged 50 to 60 per year, a third of whom were tourists.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care if participating in tours involving snorkelling or similar activities. There have been recent fatalities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are regular sightings of crocodiles along the Pacific coast near beaches popular with surfers, from Playa Azul down to Playa Esterillos, and there have been attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Safety standards for adventure activities and on small boats are variable. There have been several incidents involving small boats in the Tortuguero area, including a fatality due to a falling tree. If you plan to take part any of these activities, use an established company with experienced staff.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainforest-tours\">Rainforest tours\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting jungle areas, go with an experienced local guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-\">Transport risks \u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Costa Rica, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Private cars are only allowed to enter the capital of San Jos\u00e9 on certain weekdays, allocated using the last digit of the licence plate number. Your hire car company can give you more details.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Costa Rica for up to 3 months. Even if you have been granted a longer stay, of up to 180 days, you cannot use your UK licence for longer than three months from your date of entry. An amendment to the law is in process but has not been ratified.</p>\n\n<p>If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a>\u00a0or get an\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit</a>. Border authorities may refuse entry to right-hand drive vehicles as they\u2019re illegal and do not qualify for local insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers cause accidents by speeding, overtaking irresponsibly or ignoring traffic lights. Take care when approaching bridges over the road as these often narrow the road to a single lane.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally good on main routes. However, in the rainy season, heavy rains can cause potholes and landslides that block the roads.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident where somebody has been injured or where the other driver does not accept blame, you must not move your vehicle until the traffic police have arrived. Contact the traffic police (\u2018transito\u2019 \u2013 telephone: 2222 9330 or 2222 9245) and the insurance investigator (INS \u2013 telephone: 800 800 8000) immediately.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid using unofficial taxis (\u2018taxi piratas\u2019). Official taxis are red (or orange at the airport) with a triangular sticker and plastic box on the roof with the name and number of the taxi company. It\u2019s best to use radio-dispatched taxis. Make sure the driver\u2019s ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season usually runs from June to November \u2013 the same as the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Monitor the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a> forecasts and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://severeweather.wmo.int/tc/cgn/index.html\">World Meteorological Organization warnings</a>. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. Keep up to date with <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice and social media. Plan any local travel carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The June-November period is also the peak rainy season. Flooding and landslides may occur, resulting in road closures and driving hazards.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes: movements greater than magnitude 6 occur periodically. Local infrastructure is well-prepared, and earthquakes seldom have widespread effects. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about\u202f<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>\u202for a\u202f<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/tsunamis\">tsunami</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica has 16 volcanoes, several of which are considered active. The risk of eruptions is always present. The most recent significant eruption was at Volcan Rincon de la Vieja on 21 April 2023.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to any areas around volcanoes. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there\u2019s increased risk of lava flows.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ivhhn.org/\">affect air quality and have an impact on health</a>. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

These have been peaceful, but take care in crowded places and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take care of yourself and your belongings in the same way as you would do in the UK. Take precautions against pickpockets and bag snatchers and avoid leaving your belongings, food or drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft is a problem, especially in major tourist areas in Prague. There is a risk of pickpocketing on busy metro and bus routes from Prague airport to the city centre and trams to popular tourist sites like Prague castle. Keep your passport and valuables with you at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Report any thefts in person to the Czech police within 24 hours, and get a police report crime number. Prague police station (Jungmannovo namesti 9, Prague 1, nearest metro stop is Mustek) is open 24 hours and has English translators.\u00a0You can also get a police report from the police station at the airport.</p>\n\n<p>Every lamppost in Prague has a 6-digit number posted at eye level. These codes will help you tell the police where you are if you cannot give them an exact address.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of drink spiking in bars and clubs. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of criminals pretending to be plain clothes policemen who ask to see your foreign currency and passport. Czech Republic police officers do not have the right to do this. Do not show them your money. Instead, offer to go with them to the nearest police station. You can also call 158 or 112 to check their identity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport with you at all times for identification. The police may fine or arrest you if you do not.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prague-safety-issues\">Prague safety issues</h3>\n\n<p>Prague city police advise visitors to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always change money at a currency exchange or bank rather than on the street as this money is often counterfeit</li>\n  <li>take care when using cash machines</li>\n  <li>avoid contact with sex workers</li>\n  <li>be aware of consumption charges in night clubs as they are often high</li>\n  <li>be careful with consumption cards, which carry high financial penalties if you lose them before you pay your bill</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"drunken-and-offensive-behaviour\">Drunken and offensive behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Stag groups are not allowed to enter some city centre bars and restaurants. You may be arrested or fined for drunken or offensive behaviour. Police may take you to \u2018Sober-up\u2019 facilities for a temporary period and you may be charged for your stay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs\">Illegal drugs</h3>\n\n<p>The possession, sale and distribution of drugs is illegal, and the drugs are often dangerous counterfeits. Penalties for drug offences are severe, convictions carry sentences of up to 18 years. Some shops, particularly in Prague, advertise \u2018cannabis products\u2019, which contain trace amounts of THC permissible under Czech law. However, possessing marijuana remains illegal in the Czech Republic.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships and civil partnerships are legal in the Czech Republic but same-sex marriages are not recognised in Czech law. LGBT+ travellers should be aware that showing affection in public could receive unwanted attention. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to earn money from a surrogacy arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>The police may charge you if you are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a surrogate mother</li>\n  <li>a British national who plans to take a child born through surrogacy</li>\n  <li>an agent organising the handover</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against making surrogacy arrangements in the Czech Republic or moving surrogacy arrangements from other countries.</p>\n\n<p>You should get specialist legal advice in the UK and the Czech Republic. Read the information for British nationals on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas/surrogacy-overseas\">surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-in-groups\">Travelling in groups</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in a group, keep a note of your hotel phone number and address in case you are separated. Leave contact details with a friend or relative in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"cars\">Cars</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/czech-republic/\">rules of the road in the RAC\u2019s Czech Republic guide</a>.\u00a0The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in the Czech Republic. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the correct version of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-identifiers-and-stickers\">UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Czech Republic you are not allowed to drive with any alcohol or drugs in your system. The Czech police (\u2018policie\u2019) can ask any driver to take a breathalyser test on the spot. If they detect any alcohol or drugs, you could face a fine of up to 50,000 Czech koruna, confiscation of your licence and possibly imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s safer to use a major taxi company rather than picking one up in the street. Some taxis charge high prices. Always check the rates on the side of the taxi before getting in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-trams\">Buses and trams</h3>\n\n<p>Be careful near tram tracks and make sure you look both ways as trams cannot stop quickly. Trams have the right of way on zebra crossings.</p>\n\n<p>You may get a fine if you do not cross roads and tram tracks at pedestrian crossings. You can also get a fine if you cross when the pedestrian crossing light is not green.</p>\n\n<p>You must validate your tickets on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dpp.cz/en/\">public transport</a> in a ticket machine before you start a journey. Officials patrol public transport and will issue an on-the-spot fine of 1,000 koruna (around \u00a335) if you do not hold a validated ticket. You should get a receipt. The police can get involved and will increase the fine if you cannot pay immediately.</p>\n\n<p>The 30 and 90 minute journey tickets for bus, tram and Metro are not valid on the Pet\u0159\u00edn Hill funicular railway in Prague. You need a specific 60  koruna ticket from the vending machines at funicular railway stops.</p>\n",

If you\u2019re in Libya against this advice, you should seek to leave immediately by any practical means.</h3>\n\n<p>All travel to, from and within Libya is at the traveller\u2019s risk. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.</p>\n\n<p>On 10 September Storm Daniel struck Eastern Libya resulting in severe flooding and causing significant damage to critical infrastructure, including hospitals and telecommunications networks. You should follow the advice of local authorities and keep up to date with media coverage.</p>\n\n<p>On 14 August, clashes between armed groups in central Tripoli broke out, resulting in temporary roadblocks and Mitiga airport closure. Tensions have calmed, with roads now open and no further disruption to air travel from Tripoli\u2019s Mitiga Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in Libya and the British Embassy in Tripoli does not provide consular services. If you are in Libya and need urgent help from the UK government (e.g. if you have been detained) you can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-tunis\">contact the British Embassy in Tunis</a> on +216 71 108 700 or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Libya&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Tripoli\">contact us online</a>.

See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security#air-travel\">Air travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya.

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>The political situation in Libya remains fragile and the security situation remains dangerous and unpredictable.  A UN-facilitated ceasefire in 2020 ended militarised clashes between eastern and western armed groups, which led to an estimated 1,000 civilian casualties. While the risk of renewed fighting between eastern and western forces has decreased, the risk of localised violence between competing armed groups remains high. Outbreaks of violence between armed groups can occur with little warning. In August 2022, clashes between armed groups in Tripoli killed 32 people and injured over 150. Clashes again broke out between 14 and 15 August 2023  in central Tripoli.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign forces and mercenaries continue to operate in Libya.\u00a0 The Interim Government of National Unity has limited control of security provision across the country. The lack of political stability has led to security incidents, road and airport closures, and oil blockades. There have been protests throughout Libya against the continued political deadlock, lack of basic service provision and corruption.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against\u202f<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fadvice, you should monitor the local security situation carefully, remain vigilant, and have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-infrastructure-and-services\">Public infrastructure and services</h3>\n\n<p>The provision of basic services across Libya varies. Petrol can be difficult to access and there are regularly long queues at fuel stations. There can also be power outages in Tripoli and the south and east, particularly in the summer months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Crime is widespread across Libya and violent robbery, carjacking and smuggling of fuel, drugs, weapons and people are common across the country.  Armed groups and local security services regularly carry out operations against criminal gangs.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Foreign nationals may be a target for criminals operating in Libya and should exercise caution when travelling throughout the country, particularly at night. Consider your route and vary daily routines. Conceal expensive looking items which could draw unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention\">Detention</h3>\n\n<p>Libya\u2019s intelligence services and armed groups have detained British nationals in the past 12 months. You are at an elevated risk of detention if you are working in a field likely to be of suspicion to the intelligence services and armed groups, including but not limited to, private security, journalism or for NGOs. You should be aware that if you are detained in Libya by any of these groups, your health and welfare may be put at serious risk, especially if you have an existing medical condition. The British Embassy will have extremely limited capability to assist you or intervene on your behalf. Any assistance will be even more limited for dual nationals of Libyan origin as you will be in your home country and dual nationality is not recognised by the Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals have been arrested for failing to provide the correct documentation when requested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>In the event of a further deterioration of the security situation, routes in and out of major cities and towns may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t advertise your travel or other plans through social media. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic accidents are common.\u00a0 Facilities or services available to help in the case of a road traffic accident may be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-for-mediajournalism-purposes\">Travel for media/journalism purposes</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There are often complex bureaucratic procedures in place when operating in Libya, so it is important to ensure you follow all relevant protocols and procedures and be sensitive to local customs.</p>\n\n<p>Journalists, including foreign nationals, are vulnerable to harassment, intimidation and detention by armed groups and Libya\u2019s intelligence services. There is a real risk of hostility from those who object to media reporting. Journalism and media activity are likely to attract attention from armed groups and Libya\u2019s intelligence services who may treat foreign media with suspicion. International and local journalists have previously been detained in Libya.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of localised violence between armed groups. There is also a high risk of carjacking, robbery and of striking unexploded ordnance off-road. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk.  Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Flights to and from all airports in Libya are likely to be cancelled at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Tripoli International Airport has been closed since July 2014, following clashes that broke out between armed groups in the area surrounding the airport. Other airports may change their flight schedule without notice. Mitiga airport is Tripoli\u2019s only currently functioning civilian airport. Fighting between armed groups in the area caused Mitiga Airport to temporarily close on 23 February 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Libya that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.

These attacks killed at least four people.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. While there is a greater concentration of terrorist groups in the Fezzan Province, it is highly likely smaller numbers of terrorists can move relatively freely to facilitate activity outside of the Fezzan Province to other towns and regions.</p>\n\n<p>Due to increased security pressure against terrorist groups it is likely both Daesh and Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), are prioritising facilitation activity (such as weapons and people smuggling), to support terrorist operations in West Africa and are focused on maintaining their operating environment in the Fezzan Province. It is likely the threat from armed group violence has also helped to mitigate the terrorist threat in the north of Libya by further reducing the freedom of movement of terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in border regions presents an elevated risk.\u00a0 Extremist groups operating in the region, including AQIM and Daesh, conduct operations in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger and Algeria. They have a proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks, including in neighbouring countries and Libya.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups including Daesh, Al Qaeda and their affiliates routinely use kidnapping as a tactic and are capable of conducting kidnapping across borders. Terrorist groups within Libya have both intent and capability to carry out further kidnappings. It\u2019s a realistic possibility that they will target foreign nationals. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings, and there is\u00a0a realistic possibility that they would sell hostages on to terrorist groups. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Libya in the past, including four foreign nationals in south-east Libya in July 2018.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that any Kidnap for Ransom (KfR) attempt by a terrorist group in Libya would occur in the south of the country, whereas a KfR by militias would occur in a northern coastal city.</p>\n\n<p>There is a realistic possibility that a terrorist group, most likely Daesh-Libya or Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, will kidnap a Western national in Libya. In recent months, the importance of oil and natural gas production in Libya has increased, and any Western nationals working for oil and natural gas companies in Libya are highly likely viewed as high value targets. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel</a> page for information on the regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

You must have a temporary Grenadian driving licence. Your car hire company will help you get one, and you\u2019ll need to show a UK driving licence.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Roads can have potholes and speed bumps. Minor roads and roads in rural areas are often narrow and may have blind corners. Drivers do not always use indicators. Pedestrians often walk on the roads.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some roads are unlit at night. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Do not stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving. If you have an accident, call the police and do not move the vehicle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-minibuses\">Taxis and minibuses\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis are not metered. There are standard taxi fares for most destinations. To avoid being overcharged, agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as East Caribbean dollars.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you use private taxis, you can ask the driver to observe speed limits, but minibus drivers often exceed them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u202f\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November.

Political unrest can happen in Honiara during sittings of Parliament, elections and times of political uncertainty. Demonstrations can turn violent quickly. Avoid protests and political gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Security lockdowns can be announced at very short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor local media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force has limited resources and response times to calls for help can be slow. There have been reports of robberies involving violence, handbag snatching, pick-pocketing, distraction thefts and harassment, particularly around the central market and local beaches. There has been a recent increase in the number of house burglaries. Make sure you have effective security in place.</p>\n\n<p>Civil unrest and drunken behaviour can occur. Foreigners and expatriates may be attractive targets for violence. Take care if going to local nightclubs and be aware that such venues rarely have adequate fire precautions in place.</p>\n\n<p>Take sensible security precautions at all times, and maintain a high state of personal awareness. Be especially vigilant whilst travelling around Honiara at night particularly if on foot. Take particular care in the squatter settlements around Honiara, White River and the Lungga Bridge, Sun Valley, Mataniko Bridge, Burns Creek and Henderson (airport) area. Security incidents in these areas have included improvised road blocks, sporadic rock throwing and more serious violent criminal acts, including sexual assault, robbery and vehicle hijacking. If you plan to visit rural Guadalcanal, take day trips outside Honiara or visit the island of Malaita you should check local advice before travelling. Visits to other provinces in Solomon Islands are generally trouble-free.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are few roads in Solomon Islands; 90% of these are on Guadalcanal and Malaita. Many are heavily potholed and in some areas bridges have collapsed. Standards of driving and vehicle maintenance are poor. Be especially careful when overtaking. Many Solomon Islanders chew betel nut and frequently open vehicle doors, including on the driver\u2019s side, when travelling at speed, in order to spit onto the road. Take care when driving in and around town. Poor pedestrian discipline and speeding has resulted in a number of fatal accidents. Driving at night requires even more care as there is little street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a road accident the law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. There may however be circumstances where this is not safe, for example if a large and hostile crowd has gathered. In this case, it may be preferable to drive to the nearest police station to report the incident.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>International air travel routes have resumed but are infrequent and subject to change. From Friday 1 July 2022 domestic flights started to return to normal. When flights are in operation, reliability of services can be patchy and cancellations occur. Domestic flights are particularly prone to disruption and visitors with international connections should take note and plan accordingly. Facilities at Henderson International Airport are well below those at most international airports and you should prepare accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Domestic ferries to/from Honiara are currently operating a reduced service.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid travel on inter-island ferries wherever possible. Ferry services are usually crowded and safety regulations are not always strictly applied. Some domestic inter-island passenger ferries are operated at a nationally acceptable standard, but most domestic shipping is operated at a standard that would not be acceptable to an international traveller, and few carry recognised insurance. You should check with the operator before embarking. Bring your own lifejacket if you are taking sea journeys. Journeys to small and/or remote islands are usually in small-motorised canoes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dangerous-wildlife\">Dangerous wildlife</h2>\n\n<p>Salt water crocodiles are native to many parts of Solomon Islands, and there are regular sightings on beaches. Take local advice before entering unfamiliar waters, including lakes. There are also large species of shark (such as bull, hammerhead and tiger sharks) in the coastal waters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports</h2>\n\n<p>Many visitors to Solomon Islands take part in water sports, including scuba diving and snorkelling without incident. However, deaths and serious accidents have occurred because basic safety measures weren\u2019t taken. Safety precautions and emergency responses may be less than those expected in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There is no decompression chamber in Honiara as the Hyberbaric chamber is currently out of service due to earthquake damage.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance policy covers you for the activities you take part in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexploded-ordinance\">Unexploded ordinance</h2>\n\n<p>The remnants of war are still present throughout Solomon Islands. The condition and stability of the weapons is unknown. You should get local advice before you travel to areas including Hell\u2019s Point, Honiara and surrounding ridges, the New Georgia group of islands, the former capital of Tulagi and the Russell Islands.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"communications\">Communications</h2>\n\n<p>There are two mobile telephone networks operating in Solomon Islands. Coverage is variable but does extend to the outer provinces and is becoming more extensive. Contact your service provider for further details. Your UK mobile phone is highly unlikely to work in the Solomon Islands. Local SIM cards and handsets are available. Solomon Telekom offers a hire service for satellite phones. Mobile 4G internet services are available in Honiara. Check with the operator for tariffs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pacific-games-2023\">Pacific Games 2023\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>The Pacific Games 2023, is a continental multi-sport event for Oceania countries, which will be hosted in Honiara from 19 November to 3 December. You should ensure you plan your travel carefully during this time as there is likely to be pressure on local infrastructure and resources due to an increased number of visitors. Confirm your travel plans in good time including your hotel accommodation. Traffic delays in Honiara are possible as road and transport arrangements are adjusted. There will be an increased security presence and you should take sensible precautions, monitor local media for any security changes and follow the guidance of local authorities.</p>\n",

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h3>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are widespread across Solomon Islands. You should follow the advice of local authorities, National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Viral infections are common and you should take precautions to reduce the risks (ie washing hands and drinking bottled water).</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Solomon Islands as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

There are limited hospital facilities and medical supplies aren\u2019t always available. The National Referral Hospital in Honiara frequently runs out of blood supplies and often has a very limited stock of oral re-hydration salts, paracetamol and basic antibiotics. Wards and units can close down at very short notice. Gizo hospital is newly built and has good facilities, but can also run short of supplies.</p>\n\n<p>Take a basic medical kit with you when visiting rural and remote areas. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. To receive medical treatment in Australia, you\u2019ll need a medical visa before you arrive in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Monitor local and international media and avoid all demonstrations. Under Malaysian law it\u2019s illegal for foreign nationals to take part in demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---sabah\">Local travel - Sabah</h2>\n\n<p>There is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping in coastal areas of eastern Sabah from terrorist and criminal groups. The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines. Foreigners have been kidnapped from the islands of Sipadan and Mataking. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/terrorism\">Kidnap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Malaysian authorities have designated the entire eastern portion of Sabah, extending from the northern town of Kudat to Tawau district near the Indonesian border, as the Eastern Sabah Security Zone. They have established the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) to co-ordinate security forces\u2019 activity in the area. The Malaysian security forces have strengthened their presence in the area and introduced measures to reduce the risk of unauthorised boat landings.</p>\n\n<p>The local authorities have imposed curfews on travel by water in coastal areas of eastern Sabah. For the most up-to-date information, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sabahtourism.com/?locale=en\">Sabah Tourism website</a>, check local media or ask local police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from petty crime. Avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport whilst walking, in aircraft, cafes, airport and railway terminals, and hotel rooms. Do not open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone. Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take great care when using your card.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of bag snatching are common, particularly in major cities and including by thieves on motorbikes. Bags with shoulder straps should either be carried with the bag towards the pavement rather than the road, or tucked under the arm. Do not wrap the strap around your arm or shoulder and do not try to hold on to your bag. People have been injured or killed by being pulled to the ground by their bag straps.</p>\n\n<p>Taxi coupon systems are in place at airports. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.</p>\n\n<p>There have been cases of assaults and robbery, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. You should remain vigilant and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful if you\u2019re offered a drink by a stranger, even in a reputable bar or restaurant. These approaches can involve spiked drinks, and have resulted in cases of robbery and assault.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Malaysia with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year from your date of entry into Malaysia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>After a year, you will need to get a Malaysian driving licence. Further information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jpj.gov.my/en/web/main-site/utama\">Malaysian Road Transport Department</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals already in possession of a Malaysian driving licence can continue to renew their Malaysian driving licence as before.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions in Peninsular Malaysia are generally good, but less so in East Malaysia. Vehicles (particularly motorcycles) do not always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If you are involved in a road accident you\u2019re obliged by law to stay at the scene until the police have arrived. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to leave the scene and report to the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys.  Choose a reputable operator for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a motorbike you should take the same safety precautions as in the UK. Malaysian law states that helmets must be worn.</p>\n\n<p>Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests.  Anyone over the legal limit can face a heavy fine and/or a jail sentence and deportation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n\n<p>Piracy in South East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been a number of attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines.  Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Some passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and/or poor maintenance. Take care at all times when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat and avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-sports-and-scuba-diving\">Water sports and scuba diving</h2>\n\n<p>If you rent jet skis or any other type of water sports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use reputable licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you\u2019re insured.</p>\n\n<p>Check dive operators\u2019 credentials carefully and make sure you\u2019re insured. Check that safety equipment is available on the boat, including oxygen. Ask about contingency plans, which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>You should take great care if you\u2019re diving the sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan. They have been declared \u2018protected places\u2019 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. You should only dive there on a \u2018look not touch\u2019 basis. Do not attempt to penetrate the wrecks, which lie in deep water. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.</p>\n",

Bars and restaurants, hotels, markets, shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets, tourist attractions, places of worship and airports are all potential targets. You should be especially vigilant and maintain a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>On 28 June 2016, there was a grenade attack at a bar in the town of Puchong, injuring 8 people. Malaysian authorities have confirmed this was a terrorist attack by individuals with links to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL).</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n<p>There is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping in coastal areas of eastern Sabah from terrorist and criminal groups. The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), based in the Philippines, has previously kidnapped foreigners from the east coast of mainland Sabah, the islands and the surrounding waters. A number of hostages have been murdered by the group. Some groups operating in the southern Philippines, including ASG, have pledged allegiance to Daesh and are likely to regard Westerners as legitimate targets. In May 2021, Malaysian authorities arrested eight suspected ASG members who they suspect may have been planning kidnappings in Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes Sea. Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Sabah (Malaysia) and Mindanao, the Sulu Islands and Palawan (Philippines). Boats travelling to and from off-shore islands and dive sites are possible targets. The Malaysian authorities have increased security in the region in response to recent incidents.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

There have been incidents of violent clashes on the DRC-Rwanda border in recent years, and armed incursions into the southwest of Rwanda. On 10 June 2022 artillery fire from within DRC hit Rwandan territory close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze district in the North West. This follows a similar incident in May. Tourists sites have not been affected and the Rwandan government have assured residents and visitors that the area remains secure, but given instability in DRC further such incidents cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to visit areas close to the DRC or Burundi borders, such as popular tourist destinations including Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks, you should be alert to the risks and exercise caution.</p>\n\n<p>On 18 June, two people were killed and six were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a public passenger bus on Nyamagabe-Rusizi road, in Nyungwe Forest, Nyamgabe District.</p>\n\n<p>All travellers should keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>The land border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are open although the hours of operation may vary.

Take care when walking at night. Pre-arrange transport. Lock car doors when driving, don\u2019t leave valuables in cars when parked and don\u2019t leave cars unsupervised in the town centre. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or other valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Some off-limits military zones in Kigali may not be well-lit or signposted. You should take extra care when walking around less populated zones, particularly at night time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>\u00a0for up to one year, after which you should apply for a Rwandan licence. To apply for a local driving licence, you need to write a letter of application to the Commissioner Traffic and Road Safety attaching your existing licence and a copy of your visa or Foreign Resident ID card, and pay a fee.</p>\n\n<p>Roads from Kigali to all major towns are good. There can be landslides during the annual rains in late spring and autumn. Avoid road travel after dark as roads are unlit and driving standards are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Shared taxis (mini-vans) and motorbike taxis are the most common form of public transport within towns and around the country. However, they are also the most vulnerable to accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport may be affected by COVID-19 prevention measures. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Before using internal or regional flights that are not with major international carriers, you should check the airline\u2019s accreditation and see whether the airline operates in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation\u2019s (ICAO) safety standards.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-and-safety\">Health and safety</h2>\n\n<p>Levels of health and safety in Rwanda are lower than in the UK. There have been incidences of buildings and construction sites collapsing, causing deaths and serious injuries. Fire safety standards are also variable, with incidences of fire in residential and public places a continuing risk.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of building fires apparently caused by poor wiring and substandard electrical cables. Take extra care when using electronic equipment.</p>\n",

Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act \u2013 including funding and supporting proscribed organisations \u2013 may be liable to prosecution in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have particularly operated in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Tripoli</li>\n  <li>Palestinian refugee camps</li>\n  <li>areas close to the Syrian border, including around Hermel and Aarsal</li>\n  <li>Southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent terrorist-related incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, the police uncovered a terrorist network who were planning 3 simultaneous attacks in the southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n  <li>in 2021, the Lebanese Armed Forces dismantled a suspected ISIS cell accused of\u00a0 killing of a retired intelligence officer planning further attacks</li>\n  <li>in 2020, following the arrest of an individual suspected of preparing to conduct terrorist attacks in Beirut, there were police and military casualties in 2 security incidents linked to the disruption of further terrorist cells</li>\n  <li>in 2020, 3 municipal police officers were shot and killed in Kaftoun, Koura in North Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In response to events in Kaftoun, counter-terrorism operations were conducted in North Lebanon in 2020 resulting in deaths and arrests of suspected terrorists. During one arrest operation, in Beddawi (also Beddaoui) close to Tripoli, 4 members of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were killed. A further 2 LAF soldiers were killed when their checkpoint was attacked in Arman. Lebanese security authorities are at a high state of alert and are conducting security operations across Lebanon. Be vigilant and follow the advice of Lebanese authorities. Avoid large crowds, demonstrations, political gatherings and using shared public transport.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>If you notice or suspect a security incident is underway, leave the area immediately. Suspects have detonated explosives to avoid arrest. Keep clear of affected areas immediately after any attacks. Bystanders have been killed in a number of terrorist attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a threat of kidnapping in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have warned that foreigners could be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-situation\">Security situation</h2>\n\n<p>The security situation in Lebanon is volatile and can deteriorate quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Violence is very likely to occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>between security forces and protestors</li>\n  <li>between supporters of political groups</li>\n  <li>over scarce or subsidised resources</li>\n  <li>as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon#conflict-in-neighbouring-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-opts\">Conflict in neighbouring Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This often happens without warning, particularly at existing flashpoints. These confrontations have resulted in large numbers of casualties. Security forces may use tear gas and rubber bullets during clashes.</p>\n\n<p>There were heavy clashes in the areas of Tayouneh, Chiyah and Ain el Roumanneh, within Beirut on 14 October 2021. These clashes involved exchanges of live fire and resulted in fatalities and injuries. Weapons are common in Lebanon and groups such as Hizballah have arms that are beyond state control. Arguments can quickly escalate into violence, including the use of weapons, typically firearms and bladed weapons. There have been several reports over the past year of firearms being used during arguments in bars.</p>\n\n<p>Celebratory gunfire is illegal in Lebanon but remains widespread. Every year there are reported casualties.</p>\n\n<p>As well as internal Lebanese issues, regional and international developments can have an impact on the local security situation. This includes tensions with Israel, which could escalate with little warning. Events in Syria and Iraq may also impact Lebanon. You are therefore advised to monitor the regional situation whilst in Lebanon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-advice-for-british-nationals\">Security advice for British nationals</h3>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid large crowds and political gatherings</li>\n  <li>take cover in a building and move away from windows in areas where there\u2019s celebratory or other gunfire</li>\n  <li>be especially vigilant during periods of religious significance (including the holy month of Ramadan) and public holidays</li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.register.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/lebanon-20231013\">register your presence</a> You should complete this for every member of your family/group.</li>\n  <li>monitor this travel advice and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">sign up for email updates</a>\n</li>\n  <li>make sure you have correct and up-to-date travel documents, including a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">passport</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk\">visa</a>\u00a0if necessary, for yourself and anyone you are travelling with (even if they are not a British national) in case a sudden deterioration in the security situation means you need to leave Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there are widespread disturbances or the security situation deteriorates, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Beirut can provide. Be prepared to shelter in place for several days, if the security situation requires it. This means having enough essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. Do not rely on the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0being able to evacuate you in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"severe-economic-crisis\">Severe economic crisis</h2>\n\n<p>Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged and severe economic crisis. The situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate without warning.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0 economic situation may affect your ability to pay for goods and services. There is a very high rate of inflation. Banks and exchange houses can close for long periods during protests. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals so check with your bank before travelling.\u00a0US dollars are accepted in most supermarkets, restaurants and other outlets. However, it is very difficult to access US dollars locally. Many companies no longer accept credit debit cards so make sure you have enough cash for your stay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"shortages\">Shortages</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"medicine-shortages\">Medicine shortages</h3>\n\n<p>Many hospitals and other medical services are affected by fuel shortages. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/health\">healthcare facilities in Lebanon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) have become increasingly scarce due to the economic crisis. Make sure you have supplies of any medicines you need with you in Lebanon. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription medication, carry a medical certificate confirming that the medication has been prescribed for a medical condition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fuel-shortages\">Fuel shortages</h3>\n\n<p>Petrol and diesel can be difficult to access, with restrictions of supply at short notice. There are frequent, prolonged closures of fuel stations. Plan ahead and ensure you have enough fuel in your car before travelling. Arguments at fuel stations have sometimes become violent and involved weapons. Always make sure your vehicle is positioned to be able to leave a fuel queue quickly if tensions rise.</p>\n\n<p>Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport is sometimes affected by fuel shortages, which can cause air conditioning or lighting to be turned off in the terminal buildings. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon\u2019s power plants are only producing limited electricity for the national grid. This has led to prolonged power cuts across the country, with an impact on services, such as transport, internet, water and waste collection, and shops, cafes and restaurants. Check before travelling to a business, hotel or restaurant in case they are closed due to fuel shortages. Have a torch to hand at night and plan how you would leave your accommodation in the dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-with-israel\">Border with Israel</h2>\n\n<p>There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in South Lebanon, on the border with Israel. Tensions are high and events could escalate with little warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high level of tension in Lebanon due to the economic and political situation. Protests can occur without warning and may become violent. They have centred on the main cities of Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, but have occurred at other locations and may take place nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>exercise a high degree of caution</li>\n  <li>monitor local media for developments</li>\n  <li>avoid areas where demonstrations may be held, or where there are large gatherings of people</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with developments by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">getting email updates</a> when this travel advice is updated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>There is moderate risk to tourists from petty or violent crime. However, crime has increased due to the declining economic situation. Theft, vehicle theft and robbery in particular have risen. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>consider your route and vary daily routines</li>\n  <li>hide expensive-looking jewellery, which could draw unwanted attention</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large amounts of cash in public</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings when using ATMs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Members of the public have held up banks across Lebanon in order to access their savings, using both real and replica firearms. This may well continue. Be alert when in or near banks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault in public areas, including while walking in Beirut. Consider whether it is safe to walk alone, particularly in less busy areas. Due to the lack of electricity, streetlights often do not work, so streets are very dark at night. Consider taking a torch with you at night and make sure your phone is charged in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drug-smuggling-and-car-theft\">Drug smuggling and car theft</h3>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs involved in drug cultivation and smuggling operate in parts of the Beqaa Valley, especially northern Beqaa. Car theft gangs are prevalent and may carry out armed vehicle theft, particularly along sections of the international highway towards Baalbek. Vehicle thefts (including 4x4s) have increased significantly and are often targeted. Other armed crimes, such as robbery and kidnap, can occur in these areas. There are also frequent armed clashes between gangs and the security forces.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In Lebanon, Ramadan in 2024 will probably run from 9 March 2024 to 8 April 2024. During this time, be aware of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>playing loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swearing in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"diversity\">Diversity</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon\u2019s people are diverse, with many different Muslim and Christian sects represented. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and make sure your actions do not offend.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>In many areas you will find dress codes more relaxed than in other countries of the region, but you should still dress modestly when visiting religious sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possessing, using and trafficking illegal drugs (including small quantities) are all serious offences, punishable with prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-drones-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and drones in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Only take photographs in tourist sites. You could be arrested for photographing military sites. Flying drone cameras without permission is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The Lebanese Criminal Code includes a general provision concerning \u2018every sexual act against nature\u2019. Lebanese courts consider that this includes homosexuality. A criminal offence under this provision is punishable by a prison sentence of up to a year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://lebmash.org/resources-for-lgbt-individuals/\">Lebanese Medical Association for Sexual Health</a> has resources for LGBT+ people.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-abduction-and-travel-bans\">Child abduction and travel bans</h3>\n\n<p>If you have concerns about child custody, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/child-abduction-accredited-solicitors-referral-list\">get legal advice</a> \u00a0\u00a0before travelling to Lebanon about \u2018travel bans\u2019 that can be imposed by male heads of family. Even if you or your child holds a British passport you may be subject to Lebanese laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>In Lebanon a father or husband can legally arrange for a travel ban to be placed on their wife or children. If a travel ban is placed on you or your children, you will not be able to travel. If that does happen a parent should seek <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/lawyers/Lebanon/result?\">legal assistance</a> to check if the travel ban can be lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Lebanese family law is very different from UK law and particular care is needed if child custody becomes an issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a British national involved in international parental child abductions or custody disputes, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad\">contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>)</a> for assistance or call +44(0)2070085000. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has information on international parental child abduction, including how we can help. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> strongly advises against attempting to move your child yourself. This may be considered abduction (or \u2018re-abduction\u2019). This may be illegal and can put your child at risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"shared-taxis-and-unofficial-taxis\">Shared taxis and unofficial taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Do not use shared taxis or taxis hailed on the street.</p>\n\n<p>Only use taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>from recognised companies that use vetted drivers</li>\n  <li>recognised by hotels, which are safe and well-maintained</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies and physical attacks against passengers in shared taxis (known locally as service taxis) with passengers being attacked by either the driver or other passengers.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the Lebanese Interior Minister advised people in Lebanon not to use Uber taxis.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Lebanon. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Lebanon, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and the accident rate is high. Traffic lights are often switched off and not always observed. It may be better to hire a car with a driver if you\u2019re inexperienced. You must wear a seat belt (if fitted). Avoid travelling at night outside towns if possible. Vehicles with diesel engines are banned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Carry ID with you at all times and be prepared to stop at checkpoints to show your papers. The army has set up checkpoints on major and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary local licences are also available, but they take longer to get and are more expensive than an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>Protests and roadblocks may restrict travel at short notice. Major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport, have become blocked at short notice. If you\u2019re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving and allow extra time for your journey. If roads from the airport are blocked, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h3>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded bombs are present in Lebanon and are not always clearly marked. Use only well-travelled tracks and do not stray from their edges. Avoid remote abandoned properties. Use local guides and seek local knowledge if you are unsure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during summer. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. The authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling in Lebanon, familiarise yourself with local safety and emergency procedures, stay vigilant, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>For information on the risk of forest fires, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://drm.pcm.gov.lb/\">Disaster Risk Management website</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/drmleb/\">Facebook page</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/DRM_Lebanon\">Twitter account</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112 (for the fire service, call 175).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon is in an earthquake zone, but there have been no damaging tremors in recent years. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake.</a></p>\n\n<p>Lebanon experienced strong aftershocks from an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023. There is a risk of further aftershocks.</p>\n\n",

On 7 September, a number of injuries were reported. There have been reports of rounds reaching as far as Ghaziyeh Town (2km south).

You should pay close attention to our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security\">Safety and security advice</a> if you plan to travel to Cameroon. For more information, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tourcmr.com/\">TourCMR</a>, a National Travel Guide App.</p>\n\n<p>General strikes (or \u2018ghost towns\u2019) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February (around Youth Day, 11 February), May (around National Day on 20 May) and October (around 1 October). Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days.</p>\n\n<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are increasingly being used by non-state armed groups and have previously been used to target civilians in the North West and South West regions. They have also been used in the Far North region. There have also been a number of reported civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints due to accidental discharge of weapons.  If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Far North, North West and South West regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements. See [the safety and security section] (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security)</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should enhance your vigilance and plan your movements carefully. In November 2020, a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaound\u00e9, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2022, a number of IEDs were detonated in Mokolo market in Yaound\u00e9 across successive weeks resulting in the injury of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This follows small IEDs being detonated in populated areas of Yaound\u00e9 and Douala between June 2020 and February 2021. It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaound\u00e9 and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.\nBoko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon\u2019s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon, there is now an even greater likelihood of this occurring given the ongoing insecurity in that country. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.

Most are extremely helpful to clients.  Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK.  Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs \u2013 a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby.  Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need treatment of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the items (PPE bedding etc) and drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated. Not all pharmacies are open after 8pm. Pharmacies on call will usually have a display sign on the windows or doors.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Mugging and armed robbery are a problem throughout Cameroon but particularly in the cities Yaound\u00e9, Douala, Ngaoundere and Bafoussam.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid isolated or poorer areas of towns; e.g. in Yaound\u00e9, Briqueterie and Mokolo market, and in Douala, Nkololun, New Bell, Akwa, Bonaberi and Village. Be vigilant when walking around, particularly alone and avoid walking around at night.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in public places. Trouble can flare up unexpectedly. Make sure car doors are locked when driving around. Avoid wearing jewellery, keep mobile phones out of sight and only carry small amounts of cash and valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Close and lock all doors and windows, particularly at night. Make sure burglar proof metal bars are installed. Identify callers through spy holes before opening doors, especially late at night.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft is common on trains, coaches and bush taxis and around bus stations and hotels. Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes and many do not meet basic safety requirements. There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. You should not use taxis that you hail from the roadside (these are yellow in Yaound\u00e9 and Douala). Only use trusted, pre-arranged taxis and preferably book one from your hotel or restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>Car-jackings, kidnappings and armed robberies have occurred along roads close to the borders with Central African Republic (CAR), Chad and Nigeria, and along the Bamenda-Banyo, Bafoussam-Banyo, Bafoussam-Doula and Yaound\u00e9-Garoua Boulai-Ngaoundere roads. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon. Following the disputed election result in CAR in December 2020, and consequent insecurity in that country, there is now an even greater likelihood of this violence spilling over.</p>\n\n<p>Criminality by large gangs and hostage taking for ransom are also a threat more widely in Adamawa region. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing five people.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of kidnapping and hostage taking in the Far North, North, Adamawa, East, North West and South West regions of Cameroon. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors and residents are often targets of scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can cause significant financial loss. Scammers also target individuals and companies in the UK via websites, chat-rooms and by email. Advance fee scams are common in Cameroon. Cases involving the alleged adoption of children have been reported. Be very cautious about sending money or travelling to Cameroon to adopt a child where the information has come from a website or through emails. Cameroon does not have adoption agencies. Many victims are persuaded to pay large amounts of money before they suspect anything.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to contact the Police, call 117. If you have been a victim of fraud from a police official, you should call 1500. If you need to contact the fire service, call 118.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are active in the Far North. There is also a general threat of kidnapping, criminality and armed banditry.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the High Commission to offer consular services in the Far North, North and Adamawa regions is limited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to within 40 km of the border with Chad because of armed banditry, including poachers in Bouba Ndjida National Park in the North region.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to within 40 km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR). There have been incursions by armed men from CAR and there have been fatalities. Armed banditry and kidnapping remains a risk.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care if you travel to the northern regions of Cameroon by road. The eastern route via Garoua-Boulai and Meiganga involves driving close to the border with CAR. The western route needs travel along the Bamenda-Banyo axis. The central route via Yoko requires travel on very poorly maintained roads through largely uninhabited areas, crossing a number of bridges in a poor state of repair. There is no fuel available on the route. If you must attempt this drive, carry plenty of water, sufficient fuel to enable you to turn back if necessary, a spare tyre and a satellite phone or VHF radio to summon assistance if needed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-west-and-south-west-anglophone-regions\">North West and South West (Anglophone) regions</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the North West and South West regions, except Limbe and the 35km stretch of N3 road connecting Limbe to the Littoral region in Fako division, where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel.</p>\n\n<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are being used by non-state armed groups, sometimes to target civilians, in the North West and South West regions. There have also been a number of civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints run by either NSAGs or government forces. You should exercise caution when approaching any road block, whether formal or informal.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2019, a local commercial air carrier (Camair-Co) was hit by gunshots while flying into Bamenda Airport in the North West region. You should follow the advice of the local security authorities and/or your tour operator if you\u2019re thinking about taking this route.</p>\n\n<p>General strikes (or \u2018ghost towns\u2019) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including (around Youth Day, 11 February), May (around National Day on 20 May) and October (around 1 October). Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. You should be vigilant, monitor local media and avoid travelling within the region on such days.</p>\n\n<p>There have been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over recent years in many places in the North West and South West regions. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings are in place in some areas. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula. Cameroon\u2019s Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) patrol the waters. The ferry that operates between Limbe/Tiko in Cameroon and Calabar in Nigeria passes through areas where pirates operate. The Bakassi Peninsula is made up of mangrove forests and isolated islands that are difficult to police. Mariners should seek professional security advice and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-nyos\">Lake Nyos</h3>\n\n<p>Lake Nyos in the North West Region emitted carbon dioxide in 1986, suffocating about 1,700 people. There were no warning signs that this would happen. Although now closely monitored, this situation could repeat with limited warning. There is also a concern that the wall of the volcanic dam holding back Lake Nyos is not sufficiently strong. Nearby Lake Mounoun is also saturated with carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There are occasional isolated incidents of political unrest around the country. You should remain vigilant, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. In late November 2020 a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaound\u00e9, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2022, a number of IEDs were detonated in Mokolo market in Yaound\u00e9 across a number of weeks resulting in the injury of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>On 21 February 2021, a small IED was detonated in Etoudi market in Yaound\u00e9. There were no deaths, though some individuals were reportedly injured.  On 31 January 2021 a small IED was detonated in Douala, injuring two people, who were almost certainly the perpetrators. In November 2020, an attempt was made to detonate an IED near the rail junction in Bonab\u00e9ri, west of Douala. In the same month a small IED also detonated in the Obobogo-Columbia neighbourhood of Yaound\u00e9. Several other IEDs were detonated in Yaound\u00e9 in June, July and August 2020.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future.  You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid all travel by road at night in rural areas, particularly on the Yaound\u00e9-Douala road, where the road quality and visibility are poor, and accidents are common. Plan your journey carefully and travel in convoy, where possible. As mobile phone coverage is limited on this and certain other inter-city roads, you should consider taking a VHF radio or satellite phone.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> on first arrival.  If staying for more than six months, you should obtain a Cameroonian licence from the Delegation of Transport as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you\u2019re hiring a driver and car, make sure you\u2019re not liable for any accident or\u00a0damage.</p>\n\n<p>Roads in Cameroon are generally in poor condition. Many are badly pot-holed. Street lighting, where it exists, is poor. Pedestrians and stray animals on roads are a hazard. Many vehicles are poorly lit and badly driven.</p>\n\n<p>Roadblocks set up by the police or gendarmerie are common throughout Cameroon. You may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents. There are regular reports of uniformed members of the security forces stopping motorists on the pretext of minor or non-existent violations of local vehicle regulations in order to extort small bribes. Do not pay bribes; instead, ask the officer to provide a ticket, setting out the alleged offence so that you can pay at a local court.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>There is only one local airline operating between a few of the major cities: Camair-co.  Scheduled flights are subject to frequent delays and cancellations.  Due to aviation safety standards, we advise against taking flights that use the XIAN MA-60, which is used occasionally for internal flights.  Several international airlines fly into Cameroon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>There is a railway from Douala-Yaound\u00e9-Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9 and is considered a reliable means of transport. Details of services and times are on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.camrail.net/en/h_dla_yde.html\">Camrail website</a>.

In August 2016, the group split into two factions: Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and JASDJ or Boko Haram.

Most are extremely helpful to clients. Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK. Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs \u2013 a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need drugs of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated.

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advises against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.
