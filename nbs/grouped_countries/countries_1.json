Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can not offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Medical facilities in Nauru are very basic and medical evacuation by air ambulance to Australia is necessary in most cases. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Nauru is subject to periodic outbreaks of typhoid.</p>\n\n<p>You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a> and follow the advice of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/158/nauru#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of visitors being bitten by stray dogs. Be vigilant, particularly on the beach. If you\u2019re approached by a dog, do not run. Reaching down as if to pick up something off the ground can be enough to scare dogs away. If you\u2019re bitten seek medical attention immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Medical personnel and related flight crew, travelling to and entering Nauru for the purposes of a medical evacuation, are exempt from the travel restrictions, provided the appropriate protective equipment is utilised during the journey and in public spaces and the personnel or crew member is not displaying any symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 117 or 118 and ask for an ambulance.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can not offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel.

If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>.

Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/\">get a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a> before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p>\n\n<p>The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. If you don\u2019t have your EHIC with you or you\u2019ve lost it, you can call the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 191 218 1999 to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">Read more about what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning a permanent move to Mayotte, you consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to health care provision under the French national system. Enquiries should be made to the DWP Overseas Medical Benefits help-line on 00 44 191 218 1999. Alternatively, information can be obtained direct from the English language service of the Caisse Primaire d\u2019Assurance Maladie (French social security service) on 00 33 8 20 90 42 12 or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cleiss.fr/\">CLEISS</a> (the Helpdesk in France for international mobility and social security - English version available) on 00 33 1 45 26 33 4.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 15 and ask for an ambulance.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can not offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.

Elsewhere, clinics are generally staffed by nurse practitioners. Pharmaceuticals and prescription medicines are generally not available. You should bring any medicines you need for existing medical conditions with you. Medical evacuation from Kiribati is needed for most non-basic medical problems. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation/evacuation by air ambulance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>Dengue fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, occurs in Kiribati. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.health.gov.ki/\">Ministry of Health and Medical Services</a> has reported an increase of \u201cdengue-like illness\u201d outbreak (DLI) in South Tarawa.

Avoid eating local shellfish or lagoon fish on Tarawa.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of visitors being bitten by stray dogs. Be vigilant, particularly on the beach. If you are approached by a dog, do not run. Reaching down as if to pick up something off the ground can be enough to scare dogs away. If you are bitten seek medical attention immediately.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance in Kiribati, dial 999, then ask for the specific number (994 - medical emergency, 993 - fire, 992 - police). You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n",

In December 2021, President Adama Barrow secured victory in presidential elections.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid large gatherings and protests in public areas, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Attacks on tourists can occur, particularly the theft of passports and other valuables from hotel rooms. Don\u2019t take valuables or large sums of money to the beach, or display them in public. Take particular care when visiting isolated beaches and markets and crowded events and venues outside the main tourist areas, especially at night time.</p>\n\n<p>Both male and female visitors should be particularly cautious of young men locally known as \u2018bumsters\u2019 who approach tourists, particularly on beaches, offering help or to act as local guides. Be polite but firm in refusing unwanted help or attempts at conversation. Visitors should also be wary of offers, usually from \u2018bumsters\u2019, to take them on tours into Senegal. It is unlikely that the correct immigration procedures, which might include getting a visa for Senegal will be followed. This could result in detention by immigration authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave valuables in unattended vehicles. Take particular care in unlit areas or in places away from the Tourist Development Area.</p>\n\n<p>Corruption is endemic at all levels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travel in The Gambia is reasonably safe as long as you take sensible precautions to safeguard your personal possessions.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of checkpoints operating in and around the capital Banjul. Expect your vehicle to be searched if you\u2019re stopped by security forces.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for up to 3 months upon your first entry into the Gambia. After 3 months you can apply for a Gambian driving licence using your UK driving licence as proof of driving competence. You should apply to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.accessgambia.com/extra/banjul-vehicle-licensing-office.html\">the Gambia Police Force Licensing Department</a>. The documents required for the application include proof of residency in the Gambia, your valid UK driving licence and a copy of your passport.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a diplomat then you can channel your application through the Gambia Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they will advise you on what you need to provide to facilitate this process. They will process your application on your behalf. The same procedure is also applicable for International Non-Governmental Organizations, United Nations Agencies, and other diplomatic missions in the Gambia.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are bad and roads severely potholed. Driving after dark carries added hazards because of poor road and vehicle lighting. In the event of an accident, emergency medical facilities are very limited. Security checkpoints are common on all major routes in The Gambia. They are not always well sign-posted and you should take care when approaching them.</p>\n\n<p>Rainfall occurs in The Gambia between June-October. Heavy rainfall can create localised flooding. Take care if you\u2019re going up-country or travelling on non-paved roads during this period.</p>\n\n<p>Some local taxis are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-travel\">River travel</h3>\n\n<p>The ferry which crosses from Banjul to Barra is often crowded and overloaded. Safety measures and maintenance are not up to international standards and lack life-saving equipment and rescue services. Consider using the alternative route across the Senegambia Bridge near Farafenni. There have been several instances of the ferry becoming stranded on sandbanks. If using the ferry get out of your vehicle quickly after parking to avoid becoming trapped inside  your vehicle for the duration of the journey.</p>\n\n<p>Pirogues (wooden dug-out canoes) operate in The Gambia. These can be overloaded and safety measures are not up to international standards. They are not recommended for long journeys and you should make sure they have life jackets.</p>\n",

See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"identification\">Identification</h3>\n<p>You must carry ID with you at all times. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original locked away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"judicial-processes\">Judicial processes</h3>\n<p>It hasn\u2019t always been possible for the British High Commission to gain early access to detained British nationals in The Gambia.</p>\n\n<p>Although the law stipulates that detainees can\u2019t be held for longer than 72 hours without charge, this is regularly exceeded.</p>\n\n<p>The death penalty applies for a number of crimes including arson, murder and treason. The Gambia resumed executions in 2012. In February 2018, a moratorium on the death penalty was announced.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n<p>There is a zero tolerance towards illegal drugs. The Gambian authorities will take strong action against anyone importing, exporting or found in possession of drugs. Don\u2019t accept packages on behalf of anyone without knowing the contents.</p>\n\n<p>Sentences for those found in possession of drugs can be up to \u00a3200,000 or 15 years in prison. Westerners carrying a minimal amount of cannabis have been sentenced to ten years in prison. Cases of entrapment by Gambian authorities are not uncommon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-offences\">Criminal offences</h3>\n<p>Recent amendments to the Gambian criminal code have criminalised a range of behaviour including causing a public nuisance, which can carry a 5-year prison term and/or a fine of 250,000 Dalasi.</p>\n\n<p>There are heavy penalties for any form of sexual offence against a child. There are reports of increased child sex tourism. Report any incidences to police officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h3>\n<p>There is a zero tolerance towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in The Gambia. The Gambian criminal code states that any person who has or attempts to have \u2018carnal knowledge\u2019 of any person \u2018against the order of nature\u2019 is guilty of a crime and could face 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. The criminal code was amended in October 2014 to include Section (144A) entitled Aggravated Homosexuality which sets out 7 specific categories, including being \u201ca serial offender\u201d, where a person is \u201cliable on conviction to imprisonment for life\u201d. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Gambian law criminalises the act of men dressing as women with a 5-year jail term.</p>\n\n<p>In the years before the new government took office in 2017, some foreign nationals were detained by the police in relation to homosexuality. Although homosexuality remains illegal, the new government has taken a softer stance on many issues, including homosexuality.</p>\n",

You can get further 28 day extensions from the Immigration Office in Banjul or the Tourist Police Stations in the Tourism Development Area.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to enter The Gambia for a period longer than 3 months, check entry requirements with the Gambian High Commission in London.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/86/gambia\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n",

If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. If you intend to bring prescription medication into The Gambia, you should bring a copy of your prescription and keep items in the original packaging. Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines like those containing codeine or diazepam are banned under The Gambia\u2019s drugs laws. If you\u2019re in any doubt about customs procedures or need more information on the legal status of a specific medicine, check with the Gambian Embassy before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging.

Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In The Gambia you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores. Not all medicines available in the UK will be available in The Gambia. Travellers that require specialist medication should check availability before travel or make arrangements to bring their medicines with them. The widely used symbols are a green cross or a green \u2018Bowl of Hygieia\u2019 (a chalice or cup with a snake twined around it).

However, some violence continues involving the use of small arms, artillery and sporadic airstrikes. The earlier regime offensive displaced large numbers of civilians, caused significant civilian casualties, and severely damaged civilian infrastructure including health facilities.</p>\n\n<p>In north-east Syria, a ceasefire agreed in October 2019 remains in place but the situation remains unstable with intermittent violence.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) fighters continue to operate as an insurgency and conduct regular attacks, especially in north-east Syria. Civil unrest and violent clashes between armed groups remain common throughout Syria, including in areas of north-west Syria under Turkish control, and areas of south Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting has at various times caused the temporary suspension of commercial flights, closed roads, impeded access to land border crossing points and led to the closure of some border crossings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalism\">Journalism</h3>\n<p>A number of foreign journalists have been killed during the course of the Syrian conflict. All foreign journalists entering Syria require special permission from the Syrian authorities. Those journalists and other foreigners in opposition-held areas are vulnerable to mistreatment by armed groups as well as to explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices, and the bombardment of these areas. Others have been detained by regime security forces or other armed groups during the crisis. The security forces have confiscated phones, cameras and video cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-activity\">Political activity</h3>\n<p>There are severe restrictions on political activity. Thousands of people have been detained, and in many cases tortured and executed, because of actual or perceived involvement in political activity. Foreigners engaging in unlicensed political activity are at risk of detention.</p>\n\n<p>The regime authorities have detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity.

The ongoing conflict has seriously affected public infrastructure and services.

Electricity, internet and cellular services are intermittent in many parts of the country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>The escalating conflict has led to a rise in crime in most areas, including extortion at checkpoints, violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Fighting near airports has sometimes caused the temporary suspension of flights. Road networks may be blocked without warning. There are security force checkpoints on major road routes.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting and road closures have affected access to some land border crossing points. Some border crossings are in the hands of non-state armed groups, vulnerable to attack, and/or closed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Road travel remains very dangerous in many parts of the country due to fighting, the fragile security situation and unexploded ordnance. Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Driving at night is particularly dangerous.

Terrorist groups continue to pose a significant threat to civilians residing in Syria and have demonstrated the ability to conduct co-ordinated attacks against armed actors and civilians.</p>\n\n<p>Targets for terrorist attacks have included: residential compounds, military establishments, oil facilities, airports, public transport, commercial venues, including markets and stores, maritime facilities, land border crossings, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, large crowds, police stations, political offices/events, sports venues/stadiums and religious sites/ceremonies. There is a heightened threat of attacks against Western interests. While attacks can take place at any time, there\u2019s a heightened threat during religious or public holidays. Methods of attack have included shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals, are high value targets for terrorists, insurgents and criminals. There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attacks globally against Western interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant of this and the FCDO\u2019s advice not to travel to any part of Syria at this time.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Syria to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n<p>There is a very high threat of kidnapping throughout Syria. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain, and can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other Westerners. Some hostages have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. Westerners continue to be targeted and any Western presence in Syria would be at high risk. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"finance\">Finance</h3>\n<p>There is a range of <a href=\"/guidance/financial-support-for-when-you-are-unable-to-return-to-the-uk-during-coronavirus-covid-19\">financial support from the government</a> that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n\n  <p>For further UK government guidance on support you can access whilst abroad, visit our <a href=\"/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-where-you-are-if-you-cannot-return-to-the-uk\">waiting to return guidance</a>. This includes guidance on finance, health, and staying connected.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>There are high levels of crime, particularly robberies, within Brazil\u2019s cities and the murder rate can be very high. This can vary greatly within a city, so familiarise yourself with the geography of a city and take local advice to identify the riskier areas. Crime, including violent crime, can occur anywhere and often involves firearms or other weapons.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pickpocketing-and-robbery\">Pickpocketing and robbery</h3>\n<p>Pickpocketing is common. You should be vigilant, in particular before and during the festive and carnival periods. Do not go on to city beaches after dark.</p>\n\n<p>If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance. Attackers may be armed and under the influence of drugs. Do not attempt to resist attackers \u2013 this increases the risk of injury or worse.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid wearing expensive jewellery and watches</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large sums of money - consider wearing a money belt</li>\n  <li>avoid using a mobile phone in the street</li>\n  <li>keep cameras out of sight when not in use</li>\n  <li>leave your passport and other valuables in a safe place, but carry a copy and another form of photo ID, if you have one, with you at all times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thefts are particularly common on public beaches and include \u2018arrast\u00f5es\u2019 where large groups of thieves run through an area of the beach grabbing possessions. Keep your possessions close and avoid taking valuables to the beach.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in Rio de Janeiro are thefts and pick pocketing around Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach and the areas of Lapa and Santa Theresa.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists in Rio de Janeiro have reported armed robberies on the Corcovado walking trail to the Christ the Redeemer statue. You\u2019re advised not to use the trail at this time.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in Sao Paulo are thefts or pickpocketing around Avenida Paulista and the historical downtown area. The red light districts located on Rua Augusta (north of Avenida Paulista) Catedral da S\u00e9, Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica and the Estacao de Luz metro area (where Cracolandia is located), are especially dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>In Brasilia, the central bus station area has the highest incidence of robberies and robbery of pedestrians occurs in the Federal District area. Take particular care at these locations.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in the north-east of Brazil are theft from hotel and motel rooms and muggings. Reduce the risk of being mugged by avoiding quiet or deserted streets and / or areas and by using taxis after sunset instead of walking.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies on buses are common in many cities. According to police statistics the most stolen items are mobile phones and the period in which the greatest number of robberies occur is between 4pm and 9pm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n<p>Thefts from cars are common; keep valuables out of sight.</p>\n\n<p>Carjacking can occur, particularly on major thoroughfares and in tunnels. Approach your car with your keys in hand so you can get into your car quicker. When driving, keep doors locked and windows closed, and take particular care at traffic lights. Where possible, use the middle lane. Avoid deserted or poorly lit areas, except under reliable local advice. Be aware of people approaching to ask for information, especially at night. If driving at night outside the city, avoid stopping at the roadside \u2013 if you need to do so try to find a petrol station/other well lit area in which to stop.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-offences\">Sexual offences</h3>\n<p>Rape and other sexual offences against tourists are rare, but there have been attacks against both men and women. Some have involved \u2018date rape\u2019 drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep them within sight at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fraud\">Fraud</h3>\n<p>Bank and credit card fraud is common, including card cloning from ATMs and in shops. Keep sight of your card at all times and do not use an ATM if you notice anything suspicious. Notify your bank in advance of your trip to avoid your card being blocked.</p>\n\n<p>If you withdraw cash at an ATM and it has any sort of pink marks, speak to the bank (or police) straight away to get it changed as it may have been marked as damaged or counterfeit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"victims-of-crime\">Victims of crime</h3>\n<p>If you or another British citizen becomes the victim of crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest British embassy or consulate. You can find more information on how we can support you in our <a href=\"/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide\">Support for British Nationals Abroad</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"favelas\">Favelas</h2>\n<p>Favelas (Portuguese for \u2018slum\u2019 or \u2018shanty town\u2019) are urban neighbourhoods of high density informal or unplanned housing. They exist in all major Brazilian cities, range in size from a few blocks to large sprawling areas, and can border areas frequented by tourists and visitors.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in many favelas is unpredictable. Any visit to a favela can be dangerous. You\u2019re advised to avoid these areas in all cities, including \u2018favela tours\u2019 marketed to tourists and any accommodation, restaurants or bars advertised as being within a favela.</p>\n\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, there are favelas located around the city, including close to the tourist area of Zona Sul and Mar\u00e9, as displayed in this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://map-of-rio-de-janeiro.com/favelas-maps/favelas-southern-zone-of-rio-de-janeiro-map\">map showing approximate locations of many favelas</a>. If you\u2019re unsure about a location, seek local advice from your hotel or the local authorities.In S\u00e3o Paulo and other cites, favelas tend to be located further from the city centre.</p>\n\n<p>Armed clashes have also occurred on major thoroughfares, including the main highway to and from the international airport in Rio de Janeiro which runs alongside a large favela. There have been incidents of tourists participating in favela tours in Rio de Janeiro being accidentally shot dead during a police operations.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violence spilling over into nearby areas, including those popular with tourists. There have been injuries and deaths as a result of stray bullets in and near favelas.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care in all Brazilian towns and cities. If you\u2019re using GPS navigation, whether by car or on foot, make sure that the suggested route doesn\u2019t take you into a favela. Avoid entering unpaved, cobbled or narrow streets which may lead into a favela. Tourists have been shot after accidentally entering a favela. Check with your hotel or the local authorities if unsure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-and-civil-unrest\">Protests and civil unrest</h2>\n\n<p>Protests, demonstrations and strikes take place regularly in cities across Brazil with reports of arrests and clashes between police and protesters. More common in urban areas, they can disrupt transport. Even events intended to be peaceful can sometimes turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas extensively to disperse protesters. The effects of tear gas can be felt several hundred metres beyond the immediate site of demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>In Sao Paulo, protests take place regularly and often without warning. Roads and public transport are frequently disrupted and there can be delays along the main road to Guarulhos International Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Popular locations for demonstrations in major cities are: Avenida Paulista, and the historic downtown area in S\u00e3o Paulo, Esplanada dos Ministerios in Brasilia and Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling or live in Brazil, take common sense precautions, follow local news reports, avoid political rallies or other events where crowds have congregated to protest and comply with the instructions of local authorities. If you encounter a political protest or feel uncomfortable in a large gathering, try to leave the area straight away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carnival-and-other-large-scale-celebrations\">Carnival and other large-scale celebrations</h3>\n\n<p>If you are attending a large scale celebration in Brazil, such as the Carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro or other major cities, you should be aware that criminals can target people who appear to be wealthy or easy targets, such as people who have drunk a lot of alcohol. Be aware of your personal security and surroundings, be cautious about proposals from strangers which might take you away from public settings. See \u2018Crime\u2019 section above.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>The Brazilian authorities publish useful information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.visitbrasil.com/visitbrasil/opencms/portalembratur/en/armacao-de-buzios.html\">travel to Brazil</a> and specific advice for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rioguiaoficial.com.br/\">travel to Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.spturis.com/v7/index.php\">travel to S\u00e3o Paulo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check the integrity and safety standards of any adventure travel companies before you use them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h2>\n<p>Public transport is likely to be disrupted during demonstrations or civil unrest. Be vigilant when using public transport, especially during rush-hour as petty crime is common. Generally, the metro systems in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo are safer than buses. Criminals often work in gangs robbing large numbers of people concentrated in the same place: public transport hubs can be particular hotspots. There have been incidents of hijacking and robbery of tour buses in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licenced taxis. You can pick up a licenced taxi from the many recognised taxi ranks around Brazilian cities. Always check your taxi has the company details on the outside. Taxi apps are also a useful way to call a registered taxi; request your taxi inside if possible to avoid displaying your smartphone on the street. If your app allows this, share your journey with friends or family so they can track you.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that some taxi apps are reliant on GPS and run the risk of entering a more dangerous area of the city, in particular favelas.</p>\n\n<p>Most airports have licenced taxi desks inside the baggage reclaim areas. You can pay for your taxi in advance using a credit card or cash inside the airport rather than in the street.</p>\n\n<p>Most major cities in Brazil have facilities adapted for disabled travellers, including easy-access public buses and lifts to tube stations and platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can use your UK driving licence to drive in Brazil for 180 days, but an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">international driving permit</a> is recommended. After 180 days you need to apply for a Brazilian driving licence.  When driving on federal motorways (BR roads) you must turn on your headlights or face a penalty. Always observe the speed limit.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil has a high road accident rate. Overall standards of driving are poor. Travellers should be vigilant on the roads and avoid riding bicycles. In many rural areas the quality of roads away from the main highways is poor. Bus and coach crashes are frequent.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil has a zero tolerance policy on drink driving and check points are often set up. If you\u2019re caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will be prosecuted. Penalties range from fines and a suspension from driving for 12 months, to imprisonment for up to 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>All accidents involving personal injury should be reported immediately to the police by calling 190 or by attending to a police station to file a police report. Medical help can be obtained with the fire and rescue brigade at 193 or with the local emergency services (SAMU) at 192.</p>\n\n<p>Call the police on 190 if the vehicles involved are obstructing traffic and you need help.</p>\n\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, go directly to the nearest police station or Tourist Police (DEAT). You can also file a police report using the online service \u201c<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://delegaciaonline.pcivil.rj.gov.br/\">Delegacia Online</a>\u201d. The Military Police has a safety app called 190RJ, which allows you to report incidents and access the latest protective security advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Always use recognised national air carriers. There have been accidents involving light aircraft, which sometimes have poor maintenance standards.\u00a0A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PP\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Allow plenty of time to arrive at the airport for your flight. Traffic in the main cities, especially S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, can be very heavy, particularly during rush hour.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can travel on domestic flights with a valid photo ID or a police report in case of a lost or stolen passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>The railway infrastructure is limited and there have been safety and security incidents on this system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n<p>Be aware of safety procedures on board vessels and check the location of life jackets, including for children if travelling with them. Boat accidents on the Amazon river are not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Southwest river routes in the Amazon &amp; Solim\u00f5es river basin are commonly used for drug trafficking and by pirates. Both drug traffickers and pirates are likely to be armed and you should avoid travelling by river in this area. If travel is necessary seek the advice of the local authorities and take an escort.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed and unarmed attacks on merchant vessels, including British flag vessels off the Brazilian coast and in some Brazilian ports.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n<p>Strong currents can be a danger off some beaches. Take local advice before swimming including paying attention to warning flags on beaches and the location of lifeguards if present on the beach. Shark attacks are a danger particularly on the beaches around the north eastern city of Recife. You should pay attention to warning signs and consult lifeguards if unsure. Do not enter the water where warning signs are present; sharks have been known to attack in waist deep water and fatalities have occurred.</p>\n",

These items are often illegal drugs and anyone caught will face detention for drug trafficking regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The sexual abuse of children is a serious crime and widespread in Brazil. The UK and Brazilian authorities are committed to combatting travelling child sex offenders and the Brazilian government continues to crack down on those who commit such offences. If you commit sex offences against children abroad you can be prosecuted in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There is no legislation against homosexuality in Brazil. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil since 2013, and LGBT couples have equal rights in law. Human rights are protected by the Brazilian Constitution, and Brazil is a signatory to international and regional agreements protecting LGBT rights. Name changes on official documents for transgender people are also provided for by law, although this right is not always applied consistently across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Sao Paulo holds the world\u2019s largest Pride celebration,  which typically passes off very peacefully \u2013 incidents of violence at the event are rare.

However, Brazilian society is quite conservative, particularly outside the larger towns and cities, and LGBT-phobic violence is a concern - you should exercise discretion.

You must satisfy the Federal Police (the Brazilian immigration authority) of the purpose of your visit. You will need to demonstrate that you have enough money for the duration of your stay, provide    de-tails of your accommodation and evidence of return or onward travel. Make sure your passport is stamped. If it is not, you may be fined on departure.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to extend your stay in Brazil, you should apply to the Federal Police for an extension. If you overstay, you are likely to be given notice to leave the country at your own expense and you may be fined or deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>The Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British/Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children\">Travelling with children</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"children-who-hold-dual-british-brazilian-citizenship\">Children who hold dual British-Brazilian citizenship</h3>\n\n<p>British-Brazilian dual nationals aged 17 or younger require authorisation from both of their parents or legal guardian(s) to travel within Brazil or exit the country. When a minor travels with both parents, no written authorisation is needed.</p>\n\n<p>When the dual national minor travels with only one parent or without either parent, they must have two original written authorisations from both parents. The authorisation must be provided through a formal process called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/consulado-londres/autorizacao-de-viagem-de-menor/autorizacao-de-viagem-de-menor-no-brasil\">Travel Authorization for Brazilian Minors</a>.

The travel authorisation must be prepared in two original copies, one of which will be retained by the Federal Police inspection agent at the time of boarding, together with a copy of the identification document of the minor, and the other must remain with the minor, or with the adult person accompanying them on the trip.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"children-who-are-not-dual-british-brazilian-nationals\">Children who are not dual British-Brazilian nationals</h3>\n\n<p>The Federal Police have, at times, delayed the travel of non-Brazilian minors who lack appropriate authorisation from both parents.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

This includes Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (IS-GS), who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. The kidnap threat is most significant near the Mali-Mauritania border, compared to the west of Mauritania and the capital Nouakchott where the threat is considerably lower. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the Sahel region. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 150 and ask for an ambulance.

Fighting continues across the country, which has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and damaged key infrastructure.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/yemen/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Yemen.

Implementation may vary and restrictions can change at short notice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/yemen/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<p>If you intend to travel within Yemen, you should regularly reassess your security arrangements and carefully plan your movements. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times. You should take health and security advice from the host government, local authorities and/or competent security experts before any travel within the country. You should check your routes in advance of travelling. Don\u2019t advertise your travel or other plans through social media.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Yemen using an International Driving Permit. Access routes in and out of major cities may be closed or blocked. Check that the road is open before starting your journey. Driving standards are poor and mountain roads hazardous. There is a severe shortage of fuel in Yemen. You should avoid all road travel outside the main cities at night. Take care, there are minefields left over from civil wars and landmines used in the current conflict. Travelling off well-used tracks without an experienced guide could be extremely dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Yemeni air space is currently controlled by Saudi-led coalition forces. The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen have declared that starting from 15 August 2016, Sana\u2019a International Airport will be opened for United Nations and other international humanitarian organisations\u2019 flights.

Incidents may not be solely criminal in nature, and may be linked to terrorism or other insecurity. Tribal disputes over land are common, including in major cities, and may involve the use of weapons. The Houthis and other militias involved in the conflict are running extra-judicial detention centres. Take care at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>The conflict also extends to Yemeni territorial waters off the Red Sea and the Bab-Al-Mandeb strait. Houthi forces continue to present a credible threat to Saudi-led Coalition vessels (including to merchant vessels flagged to Coalition states) operating off the western coast of Yemen. There is an enduring risk to neutral shipping in the Southern Red Sea due to the potential for misidentification and miscalculation by Houthi forces.</p>\n\n<p>British flagged commercial shipping is updated on International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code Security Levels from the Department for Transport.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in the Gulf of Aden continues to be suppressed but there remains a threat.

On 25 March 2015 a coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, began air strikes in Yemen following the request for support from President Hadi to deter continued Houthi aggression. The UN is facilitating peace talks between the Yemeni parties to the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Air strikes and ground fighting continue throughout the country to the present day. Much of the fighting is concentrated around established front lines but these do change at short notice and there is a high risk of violent clashes in all parts of Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>Further reports of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances raise concerns, as Houthis have carried out a wave of arrests of their opponents, and the list of abductees includes politicians, journalists, academics and activists.

Future attacks could be indiscriminate, including - but not limited to - places visited by foreigners like hotels and supermarkets, transport, oil and gas infrastructure, government buildings and Houthi gatherings. Since October 2014, there have been a number of large-scale attacks against the Houthis. Maritime and aviation terrorism also can\u2019t be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks targeting or affecting British nationals of Yemeni origin also can\u2019t be ruled out. Attacks against Yemeni security forces and Houthis throughout the country continue to rise and are expected to continue as a result of their ongoing Yemeni operations against AQAP.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, firearm assassinations, kidnappings, car bombs, and improvised explosive devices (IEDS) left in locations like buildings and roadways.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh\u2019s official branch in Yemen, (Daesh-Yemen), launched its terrorist campaign in March 2015, carrying out co-ordinated suicide attacks against Shia mosques and targets in the cities of Sadah and Sana\u2019a. Since March 2015, the group has conducted dozens of terrorist attacks across the country as part of their campaign. Attacks have taken place in locations including Aden, Sana\u2019a, Ibb, Hodeida and al-Bayda. Methods of attack have included car bombings and suicide bomb attacks. The group have so far focused on Houthi, security forces and Yemeni government targets, but western interests are highly likely to be regarded as a legitimate target too.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a very high and constant threat of kidnap across Yemen. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Yemen in the last 15 years. In 2014, a number of foreign nationals were kidnapped. In February 2014, 2 British nationals were kidnapped in Yemen.  One was released in July 2014, the other in August 2015. An American national was murdered by his hostage takers during a failed rescue attempt in December 2014.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Yemen against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should pay careful attention to your safety and security. Security precautions do not remove the threat and our advice remains against all travel to the country.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) propaganda has called for continued kidnapping of westerners. However, armed tribes and criminal groups have also carried out kidnaps in the past. There is a high risk that such groups would sell any hostages on to AQAP, who have murdered a number of hostages.</p>\n\n<p>Kidnaps have occurred at various times of day and in a wide variety of locations, including public places in the capital, cars while travelling, and the victims\u2019 accommodation. Kidnapping attempts often involve the use of force and have ended in the death of several victims.</p>\n\n<p>Any international presence (including UN, NGOs, oil and gas workers, journalists, teachers, students, tourists, long-term residents, and westerners of Yemeni origin) are viewed as legitimate targets if an opportunity arises. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to terrorist hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Crime levels remain relatively high and police capacity is low. There are regular armed and violent robberies against businesses and individuals. There is a risk of passers-by being caught up in such incidents - the Police tend to respond with firearms if shot at or threatened.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the crimes in Guyana are common to countries with wide gaps in wealth and where the perception is that all foreigners are wealthy. Muggings have taken place in broad daylight, often at gun or knife point. Burglary and theft from cars is commonplace. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Try to avoid showing obvious signs of wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra precautions to safeguard your passports, money, tickets, mobile phones and other valuables. Even if you are staying with family, do not leave valuables in view. Keep them somewhere less obvious than your baggage. Use hotel safes if possible. You should be particularly vigilant when leaving local banks to ensure that you are not being followed.</p>\n\n<p>In Georgetown, avoid the Tiger Bay and Albouystown areas and take care in Sophia, all of south Georgetown, Buxton and Agricola. Take particular care in the Stabroek Market area where robberies are a daily occurrence. Avoid walking alone around Georgetown, even in the main areas and don\u2019t walk anywhere at night.</p>\n\n<p>A number of assaults have taken place in the Botanic Gardens. Birding enthusiasts should be particularly vigilant. If possible go with an organised group and avoid taking valuables with you.</p>\n\n<p>The COVID-19 Emergency Measures have banned activities, including walking, along the sea wall.  Some public parks (such as the Botanic Gardens have also been closed.)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>You should take normal precautions. Confirm the local situation in advance, avoid travel after dark, travel in convoy whenever possible and carry a means of communication.</p>\n\n<p>Guyana is vulnerable to flooding. The coast of Guyana is below sea level and protected by a sea defence and dam system. Guyana also experiences heavy rainfall. The main rainy seasons are generally May/June and December/January. Infrastructure, including drainage systems, is poorly maintained.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If possible, avoid travel to and from Georgetown Cheddi Jagan international airport late at night and before dawn. There have been incidents of violence and fatal accidents caused by erratic driving. There have also been incidents of violent theft by gangs who follow cars travelling from the airport, and attack their victims when they reach their final destination.  Always drive with windows closed and doors locked.</p>\n\n<p>Driving in Guyana can be dangerous because of poor road sense of road-users, frequent hazards, inadequate lighting and poor road conditions in some areas. Drive defensively and limit driving at night as much as possible. The worst incidents have almost inevitably involved minibuses. When driving at night take extra care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Guyana, from 28 March 2019, a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is recommended.  From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.  Alternatively, you can get a local driving permit, valid for 1 month, from the Licence and Revenue Office in Georgetown on submission of a valid British driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using minibuses. They are driven dangerously and are responsible for the majority of road accidents in Guyana.</p>\n\n<p>Although some taxis have been the target for robbers, they remain the safest means for visitors to get around town. Only use taxis from reputable companies and book them in advance (or take them from official hotel taxi ranks). Don\u2019t hail taxis from the roadside.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Tourist travel within Guyana can often involve flying in light aircraft. There has been the occasional accident in recent years on the main tourist routes, including Kaieteur Falls, Lethem and Linden, some with fatalities. The last fatality occurred in February 2019.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=8R\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) is unable to offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Guyana.</p>\n\n<p>There are some restrictions in place on travel within Guyana.  Foreigners travelling to Lethem need to apply to the COVID-19 Task Force for permission to travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been armed attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Guyana and Suriname. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Only use scheduled ferry services when crossing the Corentyne River between Guyana and \nSuriname. Using water taxis (backtracking) from Suriname to Guyana is illegal and can lead to arrest, imprisonment and then deportation.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling on Guyana\u2019s rivers use registered boat services equipped with lifejackets. Don\u2019t travel by boat after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>Although the UN\u2019s International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2007 ruled on the maritime border dispute between Suriname and Guyana, there remains a historical border dispute between Suriname and Guyana over land in the New River Triangle area in the south east of Guyana. Venezuela continues to dispute  the legitimacy of its current border with Guyana resulting in periodical increased tensions at a political level between both countries. The Suriname border issue is not high profile. The Venezuela border controversy can be. You should keep these border issues in mind if you\u2019re near the border areas, both of which are in remote areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Following elections on 2 March 2020 a new government is now in place.  In case of demonstrations you are advised to be careful when travelling around the country and avoid large crowds.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones\">Mobile phones</h3>\n<p>The following UK mobiles work with roaming services - tri-band or quad phones; Vodafone and O2. A 3G data service is also available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"electricity\">Electricity</h3>\n<p>Power cuts occur and you may find yourself without water or electricity for short periods of time. Consider packing a torch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotel-safety\">Hotel safety</h3>\n<p>A small hotel fire in the centre of Georgetown in August 2018 highlighted poor safety procedures in some hotels and the need to be vigilant. You should make yourself aware of evacuation procedures and exit routes on arrival and speak to hotel management if you have any concerns.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
