Take care of your possessions if you\u2019re travelling overnight, on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly vigilant travelling at night by bicycle or motorcycle.

Make sure your travel insurance covers medical and other costs that arise from motorcycle accidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>Call the Tourist Police in Vientiane on 021 251 128.</p>\n\n<p>Local law enforcement responses to crimes, even violent crimes, are often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have reported finding police stations closed, emergency telephone numbers unanswered, or police with no transport or authorisation to investigate crimes at night. If the police do attend, they may ask you to pay fuel and telephone costs. Ask the staff at your accommodation for help with reporting a crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Both male and female tourists have reported having their drink or food spiked with drugs and in some cases been assaulted. Never leave food or drink unattended. Be cautious about accepting drinks from strangers at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-the-death-penalty\">Illegal drugs and the death penalty</h3>\n\n<p>The possession and use of all drugs including marijuana are illegal in Laos and penalties are harsh. These include life sentences and the death penalty, with a number of Lao nationals having been sentenced to death in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>For confidential support and guidance for dealing with officials, call the British Embassy in Vientiane (24 hours).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Photographing or entering any military site without an official invitation is prohibited and you may be arrested or detained. Avoid photographing bridges or airfields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-lao-nationals\">Relationships with Lao nationals</h3>\n\n<p>The Lao government prohibits sexual relationships between foreign and Lao nationals, except when the parties have been married in accordance with Lao family law. You must ask permission for marriage or engagement to a Lao national in a formal application to the Lao authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for failing to register such a relationship can be up to 5,000 US dollars fine and possible imprisonment. It is not unknown for Lao authorities to demand entry into hotel rooms or guesthouses where they suspect this regulation is being broken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes</h3>\n\n<p>When you visit any temples and religious sites, your shoulders and knees should be covered, whether you are male or female.</p>\n\n<p>It is not considered appropriate to walk around in public wearing swimming costumes after leaving waterfalls, rivers or swimming pools.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations in Laos. Proud To Be Us Laos raises awareness about LGBT+ rights and HIV/AIDS among the LGBT+ community.  More information can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/proudtobeuslaos/\">Proud To Be Us Laos Facebook page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-rafting-and-water-activities\">River rafting and water activities</h3>\n\n<p>Travel on the Mekong River by speedboat and even slow boat can be dangerous, especially when water levels are low and sandbanks may be close to the surface. Make sure you travel with a company that provides lifejackets.</p>\n\n<p>White-water rafting, kayaking, tubing and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous and there have been incidents of drowning and serious injuries. Operators may not give the necessary safety advice and you cannot expect warning signs to tell you about currents or rough stretches of water. Take great care and check your travel insurance covers you for these activities. Make use of buoyancy aids and if none are available reconsider whether you want to take part.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0a 1949 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Laos. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Laos, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>. Roads in Laos are in poor condition and vehicles are not maintained to UK standards. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident, as vehicles often do not have lights. Livestock including water buffalo also stray on to the roads causing accidents.</p>\n\n<p>The recently opened Vientiane to Vang Vieng section of the China-Laos Expressway is the first contained high-speed road in Laos, with posted speed limits between 80 and 120km/h. Take care when using this road, as some local users will be unfamiliar with this type of carriageway.</p>\n\n<p>Motorbike rentals may not supply helmets, so budget to purchase one locally. Take extra care when using public transport or shared vehicles, as they can be overcrowded and unsafe. You can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident you will have to pay compensation for third-party property damage and injury, even if you\u2019re not at fault. As a general rule, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.</p>\n\n<p>You should get permission from the local district authorities for any travel seen as out of the ordinary, such as extensive photography, or scientific research of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>Police may stop you at any time, particularly in the evening, and ask for ID. You should stop at checkpoints and roadblocks unless you are waved on.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"anti-personnel-mines\">Anti-personnel mines</h3>\n\n<p>Mines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard throughout Laos and kill a number of people each year. Keep to main routes in rural areas, and do not pick up metal objects. This risk is higher after flash floods or landslides during the monsoon season.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to October, at the same time as the typhoon season in south-east Asia. Mountain areas are vulnerable to landslides in the rainy season and the Mekong\u2019s river basins and surrounding areas are likely to be flooded  . The Mekong River Commission posts <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/\">official updates on the Mekong River</a>. Travel to some provinces can be seriously disrupted during this time.

A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment.

Numbers of such incidents remain comparatively extremely low. However, it is advised that you familiarise yourself with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stay-safe-film\">Run Hide Tell guidance</a>, which sets out the steps to take to keep yourself safe.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks on individuals, including sexual assault and rape, are rare, but do happen. Japanese law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual and committed through assault, intimidation or force. Reports of inappropriate touching of female passengers on commuter trains are fairly common. The police advise that you shout at the perpetrator to attract attention and ask a fellow passenger to call the train staff.</p>\n\n<p>If your passport is lost or stolen, you should report this at a police station and get a police report.</p>\n\n<p>Tokyo\u2019s entertainment districts are considered higher risk areas for crime, in particular at night. Foreign nationals have been targeted for  extortion, robbery, assault and sexual assault in clubs and bars. There have also been reports of drink spiking and credit card fraud, often in combination: victims have described waking up with no memory of the preceding hours to discover that large amounts have been billed to their card. Getting a police report, which may be required by credit card companies in order for any claim to be processed, can be very difficult in these circumstances.  You should take steps to ensure that your drinks can\u2019t be tampered with: be wary of accepting drinks from strangers, and always have a trusted friend to keep an eye on any unfinished drink.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals have been arrested following disputes with bar staff and doormen, including for refusing to pay exorbitant bar bills.</p>\n\n<p>Prostitution and street touts are illegal but commonplace. Don\u2019t accompany touts to bars and clubs under any circumstances. To encourage people into establishments, touts commonly misrepresent the services on offer, and/or wrongly suggest clients are free to walk away on arrival if they don\u2019t wish to proceed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"emergency-services\">Emergency services</h2>\n<p>In cases of emergency, dial 110 for the police and 119 for the fire or ambulance services. \u00a0Calls are free of charge from any phone, including pay phones. Hospitals may want to confirm you have insurance or means of payment before accepting you as a patient.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fukushima\">Fukushima</h2>\n\n<p>There are some exclusion zones around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, which are clearly <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/\">identified by the Japanese authorities</a>. These exclusion zones are kept under review and have reduced in area over the past several years. Areas where evacuation orders are ready to be lifted are still subject to some restrictions - for instance visitors aren\u2019t allowed to stay overnight. Follow local guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant has been designated a restricted area.</p>\n\n<p>The Japanese authorities carry out comprehensive checks to monitor radiation in the area surrounding Fukushima Daiichi and to monitor possible contamination of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://radioactivity.nsr.go.jp/en/\">water,</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/food_safety/index.html\">food and produce.</a> They impose strict controls where necessary. Any significant change in the current situation will be reported on this page.</p>\n\n<p>Although the the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi site and full clean-up of the surrounding area will take many years, the risks are gradually declining.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>To drive in Japan, you must hold an International Driving Permit (IDP), a current UK licence and insurance. An IDP is only valid for use in Japan for one year regardless of its date of expiry. Check the Tokyo <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/multilingual/english/index.html\">Metropolitan Police Department</a>\u00a0website for further details. You must carry your driving licence with you at all times. Penalties for driving in Japan without the correct documents are severe.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to stay in Japan for longer than one year, you should apply for a Japanese driving licence. For more information and details of offices where you can apply for a Japanese licence, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/e/\">Japanese Automobile Federation</a>\u00a0website</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of driving insurance available in Japan: compulsory insurance (jibaisekihoken) and voluntary insurance (nin\u2019i no jidoshahoken). The compulsory insurance on its own may be insufficient in cases of personal liability.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are well maintained. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. Road rules are mostly the same as in the UK, but drivers should pay particular attention to: pedestrians crossing roads at green lights, especially at junctions; cyclists travelling on the pavements or on the wrong side of the road and without lights at night; and taxi drivers stopping suddenly.</p>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties to deter drink driving, including allowing someone else to drink and drive (for example if you are a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a drunk driver). Legal limits are lower than they are in the UK and offences can attract a heavy fine or imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 3,920 road deaths in Japan (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 3.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Japan is a stable democracy. Civil disturbances and violent demonstrations are rare. Occasionally, demonstrations of a pro-nationalist kind can involve hostility to foreign countries. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you become aware of any protests, leave the area immediately.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phone-networks\">Mobile phone networks</h2>\n\n<p>Only 3G and 4G capable UK handsets will work in Japan. GSM-only UK phones don\u2019t work, as there\u2019s no GSM network. If you plan to make lots of calls or use mobile data in Japan, SIM cards are available to hire online or in-store. WiFi zones are also increasingly available in coffee shops, hotels and other public spaces.</p>\n",

Information about the residence card system can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/\">Japanese immigration website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arrest-and-detention\">Arrest and Detention</h3>\n\n<p>Japan has a zero tolerance towards drug crime and there are severe penalties for all drug offences. Detection facilities at airports and post offices are effective. British nationals have been arrested and detained for receiving small quantities of cannabis through the mail, and for returning positive results in tests carried out by Japanese police on customers in bars. British nationals have received sentences for drug trafficking ranging from 6 to 17 years with work, or even longer, as well as receiving large fines. Prisoners in Japan are expected to work as part of their sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Police have the power to detain people whilst they investigate you, for up to 23 days, even for minor offences. If you are arrested, the police can question you before you are able to speak to a lawyer or an embassy consular officer. Investigations are not usually recorded and lawyers are not present. High quality interpretation may not always be available.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for most offences tend to be more severe than in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>If you are charged with a crime, it is likely that you will be detained without bail until your court dates. You may be subject to a communications ban if the charges are drug related, which means you will only be allowed to speak to your lawyer and embassy while awaiting trial. Legal proceedings can take many months or longer. More information about what happens if you are arrested can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-prisoner-pack\">Japan Prisoner Pack</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medicines\">Medicines</h3>\n\n<p>The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are banned under Japan\u2019s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law and ignorance may not be considered a defence. This includes Vicks Inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. If you\u2019re travelling to Japan with medication, or are in Japan and intending to import medication into the country for personal use, you should check the status of your medicine with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate beforehand. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/entry-requirements#medication\">Medication</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"family-law\">Family law</h3>\n\n<p>Japanese family law is very different from UK law. Joint custody of a child after divorce is not a legal option, and access for a non-custodial parent can be challenging. Legal custody disputes can also be lengthy, and enforcement of rulings returning a child has historically proven difficult. Japan is party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which entered into force in Japan in April 2014. New Japanese legislation to strengthen enforcement of Hague Convention and domestic rulings came in to force from April 2020. We have produced some <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-child-abduction\">general information</a> about issues around custody, child abduction and parental rights.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal, although currently there are no provisions in Japanese legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. While same-sex marriages are not recognised in Japan, some areas of the country have begun issuing equivalent certificates that can be used in civil issues, such as hospital visitation rights. Nichome in Tokyo and Doyamacho in Osaka are the most well-known LGBT+ areas. The Tokyo Rainbow Pride parade has been held without incident since 2012. In 2019, 10,000 people joined the parade and over 200,000 people took part in the two-day event. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-controls\">Customs controls</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s forbidden by Japanese law to bring meat products (including sausages, bacon and ham) into Japan without permission from the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service. Since April 2019, penalties are imposed on offenders bringing meat product illegally into Japan. For more information on illegal products, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/product/import.html\">visit the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Whale meat is available in Japan but importing it into the UK/EU is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Any importation of whale meat into the UK will result in seizure of the goods, possibly a fine of up to \u00a35,000 and a custodial sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-customs\">Local customs</h3>\n<p>Most Japanese people are very friendly and welcoming but can be reserved. Loud, boisterous behaviour is not as acceptable as it is in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to sexual conduct in private, Japan is a tolerant society. However, public displays of affection are less common than in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Drinks and meals are paid for at the end of your visit to a Japanese bar. Tipping is not necessary. In some places, prices can be high. Disputes over bills can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Tattoos in Japan have a historical association with organised crime, and while attitudes towards them are increasingly accepting, many public swimming pools, hot springs, beaches, and some gyms do not admit anyone with tattoos. Other establishments may simply ask that any tattoos to be covered up while using the facilities.</p>\n\n",

The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.

Driving standards are poor and there are frequent serious accidents. Keep car doors locked and windows closed when driving. Access in to and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night. Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark. This is due to the security situation and road safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Road blocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may be need to produce the originals. Reports of attempted robberies at fake checkpoints have increased.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on collective and public transport (buses and motorbike taxis), due to poor vehicle maintenance and low driving standards.</p>\n\n<p>Road infrastructure is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain.

In response, the government has prohibited the slaughter of cattle, goats and sheep. To date, there are no report of humans contracting the disease in Burundi, though human infection remains a possibility, through mosquito bites or for people in direct contact with infected animals.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors should be aware of confirmed cases in October of Ebola in Beni, North Kivu province in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in the same province as a previous outbreak. North Kivu province borders Uganda and Rwanda. Further information and updates on Ebola can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/ebola-virus-disease\">WHO website</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#current-incidents-and-outbreaks\">Public Health England (PHE) website</a>. These are the first Ebola cases reported since \u2018Outbreak 12\u2019 in North Kivu was declared over on 3 May 2021. No cases have been reported in Burundi.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Burundi as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

Kira Hospital, Hopital Militaire de Kamenge or Medecin sans frontieres, which operates from Hospital Prince Regent Charles, are able to provide appropriate medical care for most serious accidents within Bujumbura. Outside Bujumbura, there is a lack of adequate medical facilities and medical evacuation to Kenya or Rwanda may be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, check <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/burundi-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/burundi-list-of-medical-facilities\">Burundi\u2019s list of medical facilities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The list is not exhaustive.</p>\n",

Attacks, although unlikely, could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional acts of domestic terrorism by anarchist groups, mostly in Santiago, including the use of small explosive devices. Groups mainly target banks (ATMs) and public transport. Keep bags with you at all times, and report any suspicious behaviour or unattended packages to local authorities. Since early April 2020, there has been an increase in attacks against security forces in the Araucan\u00eda region, particularly around Ruta 5. You should exercise caution and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent protest in Santiago and other Chilean cities, particularly on Friday afternoons and evenings.</p>\n\n<p>Even peaceful protests can become violent. The largest protests usually take place in central Santiago. Police can use tear gas and water cannons against protesters.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all demonstrations. Under Chilean law, you can be deported if you\u2019re involved in or promote violent acts that could disturb social order or the system of government.</p>\n\n<p>Nationwide protests often take place on significant dates, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>11 September (anniversary of the military coup)</li>\n  <li>29 March (Day of the Young Combatant)</li>\n  <li>1 May (Workers\u2019 Day)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing and mugging are common in many cities throughout Chile.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Keep your valuables and passport somewhere secure, such as in a hotel safe. Bags hanging on chairs or mobile phones on tables can be targeted by thieves, who may use distraction techniques or work in pairs. Take particular care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>around tourist sites, and areas popular with tourists</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in cafes and restaurants</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>at transport hubs, including at the airport, bus stations and ports</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in hotel lobbies during arrival and departure</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When travelling by bus or coach, take care of your belongings when getting on and off. Keep your valuables with you, do not put them in storage compartments, especially for long journeys between regions. Be extremely wary of distractions at bus stations, where there are frequent thefts. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-theft-muggings\">Violent theft (muggings)</h3>\n\n<p>Muggings have happened in tourist areas in Santiago and Valparaiso, increasingly with weapons such as pistols and knives. Muggings can take place during the day and in plain sight of others. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly in tourist areas or near official buildings. Muggers will target:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tourists</li>\n  <li>people carrying large\u00a0amounts of money  \u2013 leaving ATMs or currency exchanges, for example</li>\n  <li>your passport (carrying a photocopy is enough)</li>\n  <li>valuable watches or jewellery</li>\n  <li>your mobile phone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not resist any attempted mugging.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in criminals:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>targeting rental cars in major cities \u2013 they sometimes puncture the car\u2019s tyres, often\u00a0while at traffic lights, distract the occupants when they notice the tyres and steal valuables</li>\n  <li>following people from the airport on arrival and robbing them, sometimes at gunpoint</li>\n  <li>targeting vehicles entering or leaving private residences while the gates are opening or closing</li>\n  <li>carrying out carjackings in Santiago, especially in affluent areas \u2013 some armed carjackers target high-end vehicles on highways</li>\n  <li>intercepting car locking systems when drivers remotely activate the lock</li>\n  <li>targeting people parked at viewpoints and stealing belongings from their cars</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings in and around the airport, when driving and on arrival at your destination. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed. Wait for gates to fully close before leaving your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance. If you\u2019re carjacked, local authorities say it is best to raise your hands and get out of the vehicle to avoid violence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxi-robberies\">Taxi robberies</h3>\n\n<p>People have been robbed by bogus and unlicensed taxi drivers, including in airport taxis. Use official or pre-booked taxis and ask taxi drivers for proof of the reservation \u2013 see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mtt.gob.cl/viaja-seguro-en-taxis.html\">how to recognise official taxis</a>\u00a0(in Spanish). At the airport there is a taxi office where you can book and pay in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Book taxis in advance rather than hailing one from the street, especially late at night. Keep in groups and avoid walking alone late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>People have been given \u2018spiked\u2019 drinks in nightclubs and bars, particularly in the Suecia and Bellavista areas of Santiago. These incidents leave victims open to theft or assault. Keep your drinks in sight and be wary of people offering to buy drinks for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry a photocopy of the photo page of your passport with you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to drink alcohol in public places including streets, roads, squares and promenades.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Using or possessing drugs is illegal and can lead to prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Chile and are increasingly widely accepted socially, although much of Chilean society is conservative.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fires-in-national-parks\">Fires in national parks</h3>\n\n<p>Open fires are illegal in national parks in Chile, outside permitted camping areas. Local authorities may revoke your tourist permit if you\u2019re caught starting a fire in a Chilean national park. You may be asked to leave the country voluntarily within 72 hours or face deportation. If your open fire starts a larger forest fire, you may also face criminal penalties and fines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to go exploring or mountaineering, tell the local authorities before you set off. For further information on mountaineering, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://feach.cl/contacto/\">Federaci\u00f3n de Andinismo de Chile</a>. For any other type of exploring, contact the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.chile.gob.cl/en/reino-unido/en\">Chilean Embassy in London</a> to see if you need a permit. The rescue services in Chile are good, but you may have to pay if they help you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Chile for 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You must have your passport and proof of your tourist status, such as your tourist card (\u2018tarjeta de turismo\u2019) or the entry stamp in your passport, with you in the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.transporteinforma.cl/atencion-de-usuarios/preguntas-frecuentes/preguntas-licencias-de-conducir/\">information about driving licences in Chile</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, get appropriate insurance. Windscreen repair can be expensive, so consider including windscreen damage cover.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get car insurance if you\u2019re driving on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). If you have an accident or do any damage to your vehicle there, you\u2019ll have to pay for the repairs yourself.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Main roads in Chile are surfaced, but you may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle in the countryside. Be prepared for a range of driving conditions, from snow and ice to hot sandy deserts. Between June and September, winter weather sometimes temporarily closes the Chile-Argentina border crossing high in the Andes, including the main Los Libertadores crossing between Santiago and Mendoza.</p>\n\n<p>Toll roads are increasingly common.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>Landmine accidents mainly affect livestock and local people crossing borders at unauthorised points. Most minefields are near the borders with Peru and Bolivia in the extreme north of Chile (regions XV, I and II) and Argentina in the south (region XII). Although most minefields are clearly marked, some signs and fences are old and damaged and may be hard to spot. In some cases, minefields are laid right up to the edge of highways.

Watch out for pickpockets especially in markets or other crowded public places. Be wary of large groups of people, including children and teenagers, who sometimes harass pedestrians for money when entering and leaving vehicles, pubs and restaurants. Tourists\u2019 mobile phones are targeted by thieves in the street and should be carried securely. All valuables, including passports, money etc should be kept in a safe place. Do not display signs of wealth \u2013 jewellery, watches etc.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime tends to increase during festive months \u2013 New Year, Tsagaan Sar (December \u2013 February) and Naadam (July).  Always be alert and always take precautions, especially during these months and when using Public Transport.\nThe majority of crime committed against foreign nationals in Mongolia is non-violent, although violent incidents including robberies and sexual assault do occasionally occur. There have been reports of foreigners being robbed and assaulted in Ulaanbaatar, especially when walking alone at night, or using unlicensed taxis. Take additional care if away from the city centre area.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities request all crimes be reported. This allows them to investigate and record crime in Mongolia. The Police will only require you report the crime, you are free to depart once the crime is reported.</p>\n\n<p>Report any crime to the nearest district police station. In an emergency call the police on 102 or +976 102 from an international mobile phone. There should be someone available on this number who can speak to you in English.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Travelling across the Mongolian countryside can be difficult and potentially dangerous if you are not familiar with the terrain. Mongolia does not have an extensive road network. You may need to follow tracks in the dust, mud or sand and there will not necessarily be other traffic to follow if these give out.</p>\n\n<p>People travelling in Mongolia should be aware of local road conditions, weather forecasts and have researched the areas they will travel through.   The knowledge of a local guide or driver can be an advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are large areas of the country without mobile phone coverage. It is recommended that you take back-up communications like a satellite phone, plenty of water and provisions. Make a contingency plan and make sure someone knows your route and expected times of arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling to the more remote parts of the country and are not part of an organised group, we advise you use local guides and/or notify National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) of your plans.  NEMA has an English website on which you can email them. You are also advised to have the phone numbers for local NEMA and the Police offices in the provinces you visit.</p>\n\n<p>Mongolia is a large country with varying weather conditions, you should always follow the weather forecasts when travelling. The country experiences extremes of weather, from +35C in summer to -40C in winter. Even in summer, evenings can be cold because of the altitude. Weather conditions can change without warning. There are very long distances between settlements. Take appropriate provisions, including warm clothing, blankets, food and water if you\u2019re travelling outside urban areas. You should carry a First Aid kit and supply of prescription medicines when travelling outside Ulaanbaatar.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mongolia/health\">health</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Driving in Mongolia can be difficult and dangerous. Wear seat belts and where possible avoid driving at night. If possible, use an experienced, professional driver, familiar with the driving conditions and geography of the countryside. Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are large areas of the country without mobile phone coverage.</p>\n\n<p>Only 10% of the country\u2019s road are tarmacked and there is minimal signposting. Driving standards have not kept pace with the dramatic growth in the number of vehicles and are highly variable. Vehicle maintenance can be poor, even for rental vehicles.\nDriving in Ulaanbaatar is hazardous as roads are heavily congested. There are a high number of accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Outside Ulaanbaatar you should always be conscious of animals on the road when driving.  You should plan your journey carefully taking into account your route, weather forecast and fuel stops.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in Mongolia you need an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldrivingpermit.org/\">International Driving Permit</a>. You should also try to familiarise yourself with local laws.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"communications\">Communications</h2>\n\n<p>Most UK phone networks work in cities, but the network can be weak in rural areas. \nWifi is available in many hotels, restaurants and bars, especially in Ulaanbaatar but less so across the rest of the country. You can buy local SIM cards and mobile phones at a reasonable price.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Evidence suggests that domestic services (including helicopter services) in Mongolia do not always comply with international safety standards. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017 the International Civil Aviation Organisation <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a>, evaluating Mongolia\u2019s safety oversight capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=MT\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Flights can be subject to disruption due to weather conditions and maintenance issues. Bear this in mind when making your travel plans.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are known to be used for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure. Do not pack something in your luggage or transport any items for someone else.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There have been occasional instances of civil and political unrest resulting in demonstrations and in some cases violence. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.</p>\n\n",

If you\u2019re caught purchasing or trafficking illegal goods you\u2019ll be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence and fine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"antiques-trade\">Antiques trade</h2>\n\n<p>In purchasing antiques make sure the supplier presents a certificate of authenticity for the item. You will need the document for exporting the item. Mongolian Customs produces an import, export guide on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/clearance/prohibited\">prohibited items</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you become involved in a commercial dispute or a criminal investigation, you may be prevented from leaving Mongolia until the issue is resolved through a travel ban. If you\u2019re subject to a travel ban, you should inform the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-ulaanbaatar\">British Embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you bring a car into Mongolia you may have to pay a small fee. If you do not leave with your car, you may also have to pay an import tax either on departure or at a later date when you\u2019ve returned to the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h2>\n<p>Although not illegal, homosexuality is not generally accepted socially.

If you\u2019re unsure how Mongolia\u2019s entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>Visitors wanting to stay for less than 30 days no longer need a visa to enter Mongolia.</p>\n\n<p>For stays longer than 30 days you will need a visa to enter or travel through Mongolia as a visitor. You should contact the nearest Mongolian Embassy for the most up-to-date advice on entry requirements and visas. Arriving passengers should follow instructions given by the authorities on arrival. Arrival requirements into Mongolia are subject to change. Borders between China and Mongolia are closed except for freight traffic.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 related restrictions for entry to Mongolia have been lifted for all UK travellers. Negative COVID-19 PCR tests before and after arrival are no longer required.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"children-and-young-people\">Children and young people</h2>\n<p>Children aged 17 and under follow the same rules as adults and do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Mongolia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-youre-transiting-through-mongolia\">If you\u2019re transiting through Mongolia</h2>\n\n<p>Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.</p>\n\n<p>Transiting through Mongolia is permitted for travellers irrespective of their vaccination status.</p>\n\n<p>If you are transiting through Mongolia on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) or are transiting through Mongolia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you should check with your travel operator and the authorities at your final destination what the entry requirements might be.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"onward-travel\">Onward travel</h3>\n\n<p>For onward travel from Mongolia to third countries, please check the UK\u2019s Travel Advice for those countries.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that it can be difficult to get visas for China and Russia in Mongolia. If you\u2019re planning to travel to China or Russia from Mongolia, seek advice from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/visa/\">Chinese</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ru.vfsglobal.co.uk/contact_us.html#1\">Russian</a> Embassies in London for the latest visa requirements before you travel to Mongolia. Foreigners who are not residents of Mongolia have not always been able to get Chinese visas from the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar. If you plan to travel to Mongolia and then onward to China, you should get your Chinese visa before the start of your trip.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hgv-drivers\">HGV drivers</h3>\n\n<p>HGV drivers from the UK entering Mongolia do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-your-passport-and-travel-documents-before-you-travel\">Check your passport and travel documents before you travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting Mongolia, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a resident in Mongolia, your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>You no longer need a visa to enter or travel through Mongolia as a visitor.  A British National can enter visa free and remain in Mongolia for a stay of up to 30 days within six months from the date of issue. You can extend your visa up to 30 days once within six months. Full details can be found at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://consul.mn/eng/index.php?moduls=20\">Immigration of Mongolia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Mongolian Border Agency will collect biometric data (scanned fingerprints) on your arrival.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"online-visa-for-non-tourists\">Online visa for non-tourists</h2>\n\n<p>From November 2021, British citizens can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.evisa.mn/main\">apply for the following 3 types of visas online</a></p>\n\n<p>You no longer need to visit your nearest Mongolian Embassy if applying for visas under the above categories. E-visas will normally be issued within 72 hours of application. Applicants should carry a digital or printed version of the visa to present to airlines and the Mongolian Authorities on arrival.</p>\n\n<p>British citizens who wish to travel to Mongolia for business, staying longer than 30 days, need to apply for a business visa (B). They will need the documented support of the company they will visit in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals need to login to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://evisa.mn/\">immigration website</a> and upload the invitation letter, application etc as per instructions. If all the required documents are provided, the immigration authority will inform the individual via email or text message. Once permission is granted, the foreign citizen can get a Mongolian visa on arrival. You should make sure you have the confirmation before travelling to Mongolia.</p>\n\n<p>You should remember that at the entry point, the immigration authority might interview you and they can refuse your entry to Mongolia. It is important for the inviting individual or company to provide full and true information about the person.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-visas\">Other visas</h3>\n\n<p>If you are unsure of the type of visa required, or require another type of visa, contact the nearest <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassyofmongolia.co.uk/?lang=en\">Mongolian Embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children\">Travelling with children</h3>\n\n<p>Adults accompanying children other than their own should have a notarised letter from the legal guardians of the child confirming the arrangement. For further information contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.embassyofmongolia.co.uk/\">Embassy of Mongolia in London.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registration\">Registration</h3>\n\n<p>If you intend to remain in Mongolia for more than 30 days or if you do not have an entry/exit visa, you must register your stay with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.immigration.gov.mn/\">Mongolian Immigration Agency</a> in Ulaanbaatar within a week of arriving. Once registered you will be issued with a residence permit. The permit will include your date of birth, passport number, address, photograph and fingerprints. You should carry it with you at all times when you\u2019re in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>There are normally 8 border points open to British passport holders. They are at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar, the road/train crossing to China at Zamin Uud, the road crossing to China at Bulgan in the west, the road crossing to China at Bichigt in the south east, the road crossing to Russia at Tsagaannuur in the far west, the train crossing to Russia at Sukhbaatar and the road crossings to Russia at Altanbulag and Ereen-Tsav. You may not cross into China or Russia at any of the other border points as they are either seasonal or are open only to Mongolians, Chinese or Russians.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to bring a vehicle into Mongolia at any of the border crossings you should inform the tax authorities and border troops in advance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by train across the China/Mongolia border expect a delay of a few hours as the railways use different gauges.</p>\n\n<p>You may encounter problems when entering Mongolia by train from Russia, particularly with Russian border or customs officials who scrutinise documentation (in particular customs declarations) very carefully. If you\u2019re crossing overland to or from Russia, pay scrupulous attention when completing all the necessary paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-mongolia-by-car\">Entering Mongolia by car</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia by car you should familiarise yourself with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/2012-03-14-03-21-37/2012-03-14-03-22-33/278-regarding-the-regulations-and-procedures-to-cross-motor-vehicles-through-the-mongolian-border\">Mongolian Customs law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia in a private vehicle you should complete the customs declaration form and make sure you have all valid vehicle documents, including driving licence, ownership records and insurance. You can complete the customs declaration forms on entry at the border, as well as at the Ulaanbaatar City Customs Office situated next to the train station in Ulaanbaatar.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Mongolia in a private vehicle you must leave in the same vehicle, or otherwise pay customs tax. The amount of tax depends on the size of the engine and the value of your vehicle. You can find more details on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/k2-items/2014-03-25-01-12-56\">Mongolian Customs\u2019 webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle breaks down in Mongolia, you won\u2019t be able to leave it there without paying customs tax. If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed you must either pay for it to be transported out of Mongolia, or sell it on to a local mechanic, but you\u2019ll still need to pay customs tax. You mustn\u2019t under any circumstance leave your vehicle unattended or abandon it.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re leaving your vehicle in Mongolia you must leave it in a secure place, either with a mechanic or at an official Customs warehouse, for which you will need to submit a completed customs declaration form and pay a monthly fee for storage. If you leave your vehicle with a mechanic in Mongolia because it cannot be fixed, you must provide proof (photos and a letter from a mechanic and a police report) of this to the Customs Office. If you choose to sell your vehicle, you\u2019ll need to show proof of sale.</p>\n\n<p>Customs tax is payable in local currency (MNT) only and must be paid directly to the Customs Office. If you wish to leave your vehicle and then return to collect it at a later date you should still pay the tax up front, which can then be reimbursed to you when you return to take your vehicle out of Mongolia. If you aren\u2019t able to return in person, ask a third party to make the initial tax payment, and then collect the refund on your behalf.</p>\n",

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. You\u2019re only allowed to bring medicines for personal use into Mongolia. These include medicines for urgent aid for up to 7 days or for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, mental illness or HIV/AIDS for which you have a doctor\u2019s prescription. If you\u2019re arriving by plane, you should carry all medicines in your checked baggage.

Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/ulaanbaatar/us-embassy/\">AQICN website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>There have been isolated incidents of bubonic plague in some rural areas of Mongolia, caught by consuming marmot meat. The meat is a delicacy in some rural areas although it is illegal to hunt for marmot in Mongolia. When travelling in rural areas, you should avoid marmot meat and follow the latest advice from the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you have been exposed to Bubonic Plague whilst travelling in Mongolia, you should immediately report to the nearest hospital and call the National Infectious Disease Centre on +976 100. You should contact the British Embassy if you or your group is quarantined due to an incident involving Bubonic Plague.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n<p>You should always have medical insurance arranged before travelling to Mongolia. Medical bills, especially when a medical evacuation is needed, can be substantial. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals requiring medical treatment in Mongolia, are required to pay 80% of the total cost when receiving treatment. The remaining balance paid after treatment.<br>\nWe advise you wear a helmet when riding animals.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial +976 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible to inform them of what has happened.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of healthcare is variable in Mongolia. In Ulaanbaatar the quality and access can differ in some private clinics operating in the city. Once outside Ulaanbaatar, the level of care will vary with limited options available to receive treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the size of the county those injured in remote parts of the country may have long travel times before reaching the nearest medical facility.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of treatment is fixed, and most procedure are costed so you should be able to confirm cost before treatment. Medical supplies are mainly from China and Russia, so you may not recognise the medicine you are being offered.</p>\n\n<p>You should always carry a first aid kit, have supplies of over-the-counter medicines you may require for your trip.</p>\n\n<p>You should always bring any regular prescription drugs you may need with you, and spare, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>If a patient\u2019s injury is life threatening the doctors will treat that patient without individual/family permission.</p>\n\n",

Be very cautious about any approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Genuine plain-clothed police will rarely carry out this type of inspection. Dutch police don\u2019t have shiny badges, which the fake police sometimes present as ID.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be cautious if approached</li>\n  <li>ask for identity and check it thoroughly</li>\n  <li>not let them intimidate you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Call 0900-8844 to contact the nearest police station if you are unsure whether a police person is genuine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drug-sellers\">Drug sellers</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid confrontation with anyone offering you drugs.

For people aged 16 or over who fail to comply with the requirement to identify themselves, the fine is 100 euros. For persons aged 14 and 15, the fine is 50 euros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t carry or use drugs. The Netherlands has a reputation for being tolerant on the use of \u2018soft drugs\u2019, such as cannabis. However, drugs are illegal and drug use is only tolerated in designated premises in the major cities. Buying or possessing prohibited drugs and substances outside of designated areas, is illegal and can result in a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Buying or smoking soft drugs in public places is an offence. There are specific caf\u00e9s where the use of cannabis is tolerated.</p>\n\n<p>The sale of dry and fresh psychoactive mushrooms is illegal. However, the truffle (sclerotium) form of psychoactive (psilocybin) mushrooms are not covered under Dutch law (Opium Act) and are still sold in regulated \u2018smart shops\u2019.

Avoid carrying large amounts of money or valuables around with you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Seek the advice of your hosts about appropriate security measures. If possible you should arrange to be met on arrival in Algiers. You should stay at one of the main hotels where proper security precautions are taken.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, make journeys by air and stay in pre-arranged accommodation at your destination. Business visitors without established contacts should seek advice in the first instance from the British Embassy Algiers or the Algeria desk in the Department for International Trade.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling as a tourist, confirm your travel plans before you arrive in Algeria, using a reputable tour operator with good local knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s generally safe to move around the centre of Algiers during the day. Ideally, travel around with someone who knows the city well. Avoid areas that you don\u2019t know, particularly in the suburbs of the city and especially after dark. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you. If you plan to tour the Casbah area of Algiers, use a good local guide and make sure local police and your hosts/hotel know about your plans. Don\u2019t accept lifts from people you don\u2019t know - use a taxi service recommended by the hotel.</p>\n\n<p>Wildfires caused significant damage and numerous deaths in wilayas east of Algiers in summer 2022 and 2021 throughout August 2021. Similar fires could flare up in the same or other areas without warning, especially during periods of extreme weather. You should follow local advice and avoid travelling to areas where fires may break out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-arrangements\">Security arrangements</h3>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. In cities there\u2019s a clear security presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling independently, inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. Your hotel should be able to help you with contacting local authorities. This doesn\u2019t apply if you have dual Algerian nationality. You should accept any security escort you\u2019re offered and co-operate with authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Although you may drive in Algeria with a valid UK driving licence for a maximum of 3 months, the Algerian authorities may also request an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You\u2019re strongly advised to apply for a valid IDP for your temporary stay in Algeria. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. For more information on local regulations, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.interieur.gov.dz/index.php/fr/mes-d%C3%A9marches-administratives/permis-de-conduire\">Algerian Interior Ministry</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>While the major road system has improved, take particular care on minor roads and at night. Algeria has a very high road traffic accident rate. If possible travel in a convoy of at least 2-3 vehicles outside the main towns.</p>\n\n<p>If you are taking a taxi, ask your hotel to phone a reputable firm and don\u2019t allow other unknown passengers to join you during the journey. Arrange with the driver to collect you for the return journey as taxis are not widely available, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h2>\n\n<p>Algerian family law is different from UK law. If you\u2019re a dual British-Algerian national, take particular care if <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/permission-take-child-abroad\">child custody</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/stop-forced-marriage\">forced marriage</a> is likely to become an issue during your stay. Children (under the age of 19 years and one day) leaving Algeria need written authorisation from their parent with legal guardianship to travel if they\u2019re travelling alone or accompanied by an adult. If you have any concerns, seek advice before travelling to Algeria or agreeing to family members travelling to Algeria.</p>\n",

The largest presence is in the southern desert region and in areas bordering Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali and Mauritania. Terrorists also operate in small numbers in mountainous areas in the north. However, there remains a high risk of terrorist attacks throughout the country including in Algiers and other major cities, and against UK and Western interests.  It is possible that terrorist groups will exploit targets of opportunity for attack or kidnap.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and other regional Islamist groups including Al Murabitun and Daesh-affiliates. There\u2019s also a threat from individuals inspired by Daesh. These groups have been active across the country and pose a threat throughout Algeria, including in Algiers and other major cities.</p>\n\n<p>The threat from terrorism is higher in some parts of the country:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the southern border (where the kidnap risk is concentrated)</li>\n  <li>the Libyan and Tunisian borders;</li>\n  <li>rural, and in particular mountainous, areas in the north and between Tunisia and Algiers;</li>\n  <li>the Sahara.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities continue to conduct effective counter terrorism operations to disrupt terrorist activity but there\u2019s a continuing threat of further terrorist attacks. You should be vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks against Algerian government interests and security forces, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 14 October 2021, a soldier was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device whilst conducting a routine patrol in the province of Tlemcen</li>\n  <li>on 6 August 2021, two soldiers were killed by an Improvised Explosive Device whilst conducting a search and sweep operation in the province of Ain Defla</li>\n  <li>on 2 January 2021, two soldiers were killed whilst conducting a search and sweep operation in the province of Tipasa</li>\n  <li>on 20 June 2020, an ambush in Ain Defla, North West Algeria, led to the death of an Algerian army corporal. AQIM is reported to have claimed responsibility</li>\n  <li>on 9 February 2020, one Algerian soldier was killed in a suicide attack on a military outpost in Timeaouine, close to the Malian border. Daesh is reported to have claimed responsibility</li>\n  <li>on 18 November 2019, during an operation by the Algerian army in the southern Tamanrasset region, two alleged IS members were killed. Daesh have reported this same incident as an attack killing eight Algerian security forces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been attacks and threats made against foreign and economic interests, including oil and gas facilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 18 March 2016, AQI-M attacked the In Salah Gas Joint Venture in central Algeria with explosive munitions fired from a distance. There were no injuries or casualties</li>\n  <li>on 16 January 2013 Al Murabitun attacked a gas plant near In Amenas killing 40 foreign workers, including 6 British nationals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indiscriminate attacks are not common but on 8 October 2021, 3 civilians were seriously injured by IED explosions in Tebessa and Batna and on 16 January 2021, a roadside bomb killed 5 Algerian citizens in Telidjane, Tebessa province, on the border with Tunisia. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for placement of the landmines, but denied that they were targeting civilians.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a kidnap threat to visitors in Algeria, particularly in the southern and eastern border areas (bordering Mali and Libya respectively). Terrorist kidnappers have previously targeted foreigners, government officials and civilians in Algeria and the Sahel region. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel page</a> for information on the Sahel regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n<p>Facilities at private clinics are usually better than at government hospitals. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial (0)21711414 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, there have been some reports of hospitals coming close to treatment capacity.</p>\n",

If you\u2019re unsure how Algeria\u2019s entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<p>On 30 October 2022, the Algerian authorities announced the lifting of all entry requirements related to Covid-19.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>Before you travel, you will need to get a visa from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.algerianembassy.org.uk\">Algerian\u00a0Consulate in London</a>. You can\u2019t get a visa on arrival. You should check the details of your visa, including validity dates, before travelling. Should you overstay the duration of your visa or the time you are permitted to stay in country as granted upon arrival, you are likely to be detained by the immigration police at the airport whilst attempting to exit Algeria. This may result in a criminal prosecution and up to 3 months in jail. If you need to stay in Algeria for a longer period than your visa or entry stamp allows, you may be able to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.interieur.gov.dz/images/demmande-visa.pdf\">extend your visa</a> at the Wilaya (Town Hall) nearest to you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"algerian-border\">Algerian border</h3>\n\n<p>The land border between Algeria and Morocco is closed. Do not attempt to cross it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Algeria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leaving-algeria\">Leaving Algeria</h3>\n\n<p>When exiting Algeria, the Algerian authorities usually require sight of the document you used to enter the country. In the event that your passport was lost or stolen during your stay in Algeria, you will need to present a police report to the border police to show why you are no longer in possession of the passport you used to enter Algeria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/3/algeria#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-with-children\">Travel with children</h3>\n\n<p>In Algeria, the age of majority (when a child is legally recognised as an adult) is 19 years and 1 day old. Any person under this age whose father is an Algerian citizen will be regarded as Algerian if the father\u2019s name is on the birth certificate. Any such child leaving Algeria without the father will only be able to travel if the father signs an \u2018Autorisation Paternelle\u2019 or, if travelling with just one parent, the parent (whether mother or father) will be expected to prove their parental link through a Livret de famille or a certified copy. Unaccompanied minors will need a letter from their parent or guardian granting them permission to travel out of the country.</p>\n\n<p>For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.algerianembassy.org.uk\">Algerian Consulate in London</a>.</p>\n\n",

A further 22 people were injured</li>\n  <li>in 2019, 27 people were killed and many more injured as a result of bomb attacks at a Roman Catholic cathedral on Jolo Island in Sulu Province</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnap by terrorist groups operating in the Philippines, including the targeting of foreign nationals in rural, urban and coastal areas.</p>\n\n<p>Kidnap for ransom operations continue to represent a potential source of revenue for both criminal and terrorist groups operating in the southern Philippines, specifically on Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.</p>\n\n<p>The primary threat in the Philippines has historically been posed by the Abu Sayyaf Group (<abbr title=\"Abu Sayyaf Group\">ASG</abbr>), who kidnapped a number of Westerners over the 2010s, including British nationals as recently as 2019. <abbr title=\"Abu Sayyaf Group\">ASG</abbr> has, in more recent years, targeted local fishermen in kidnap operations, but may still consider Westerners desirable targets.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The Philippines Bureau of Immigration has warned foreign nationals against participating in public protests and political rallies. If you participate, you may be detained and deported. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"robbery\">Robbery</h3>\n\n<p>There are high levels of street crime and robbery, sometimes involving weapons and firearms.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant when travelling on public transport and avoid displaying cash or jewellery. Armed hold-ups on \u2018jeepneys\u2019 and buses can happen, particularly in Manila and other large cities. In some cases these have resulted in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by taxi, including to or from the airport, only use taxis from a reputable company. Some taxi drivers and their accomplices have robbed and harmed passengers. Consider arranging to be met at the airport or using a hotel transfer service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must be able to show some identification if requested by the police. If you want to keep your passport in a safe place, such as in a hotel safe, you should carry a photocopy of the photo page containing your personal details.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h2>\n\n<p>Violating local laws may result in a jail sentence, served in a local prison. Sentences are severe. The judicial system allows long-term detention until a court hearing takes place. Foreign nationals have been known to spend several years in prison on remand while their cases are processed. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/philippines-prisoner-pack\">detention facilities and prison conditions</a> are far below UK standards.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for importing and using illegal drugs are particularly severe. A conviction for possession of even a small amount of any illicit drug in the Philippines means a mandatory jail sentence. Police and other authorities have been publicly encouraged to kill suspected drug traffickers who resist arrest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"laws-on-child-abuse-and-rape\">Laws on child abuse and rape</h3>\n\n<p>Child abuse and rape are punished with extremely long prison sentences. Be cautious about strangers offering friendship. There have been cases where women, single or sometimes with children, have befriended single male tourists and then threatened to report rape or abuse in an apparent attempt to extort money. A child is defined in Philippine law as a person aged 17 and under.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The Philippines is generally a tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers, although some stigma exists outside urban centres. Current legislation does not recognise same-sex marriage. Same-sex relationships are not illegal in the Philippines, but overt public displays of affection may be considered a \u2018grave scandal\u2019 under the Revised Penal Code\u00a0, and you could get a fine or a 6-month jail sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"recruiting-filipinos-for-employment\">Recruiting Filipinos for employment</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to recruit Filipinos for employment in the UK or elsewhere, you must be licensed by the relevant government authority. The laws relating to illegal recruitment are strict.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"independent-travel-and-adventure-tourism\">Independent travel and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel within the Philippines, away from the main resort areas and tourist spots, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dilg.gov.ph/\">authorities in the local area</a> as part of your preparation.</p>\n\n<p>Always leave travel plans, passport details \u00a0and credit cards with friends, colleagues or relatives. Carry identification such as a driving licence or passport copy at all times, and make sure the emergency contact details in your passport are up to date. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h3>\n\n<p>Swimming and surfing beaches are unlikely to have lifeguards or warning signs, so get advice from your hotel or local residents before starting any activities. The seas can be extremely dangerous and British nationals are regularly in trouble in the water, or even drown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scuba-diving\">Scuba diving\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Diving school standards are not always as high as in the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check a dive operator\u2019s credentials</li>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re covered by insurance</li>\n  <li>make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen</li>\n  <li>ask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have not had any previous diving experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your dive instructor to explain what cover they offer before signing up</li>\n  <li>check what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in the Philippines on a UK driving licence for up to 90 days. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check their requirements before you travel. If you\u2019re staying longer than 90 days, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lto.gov.ph/\">apply for a Philippine driving licence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Accidents happen frequently, mainly due to poor road conditions, dangerous driving and non-enforcement of traffic laws. Observe the speed limit and be cautious around motorbikes and scooters. Avoid driving at night or during dangerous weather conditions if possible. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Safety standards on taxis and buses can be low. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When travelling by private car, taxi or any shared transport, you can expect a routine security presence with random checkpoints along the roads. Always co-operate with officials and allow extra time to pass through security checks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high level of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">piracy and armed robbery against ships</a> in and around the Sulu and Celebes seas. Boats travelling to and from offshore islands and dive sites are also possible targets.</p>\n\n<p>The ferry and passenger boat network has a poor record of maritime safety. Boats sometimes lack lifesaving equipment, and maritime rescue services may be limited. You should be cautious when using ferries and avoid overcrowded boats. Accidents are more frequent during the rainy season between June and December when storms can develop quickly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"typhoons\">Typhoons</h3>\n\n<p>Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year. Most typhoons occur from June to November. Follow the advice of local authorities, and monitor the progress of storms on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/\">Philippines state weather agency</a>, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/index.php\">Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.typhoon2000.ph/\">typhoon.com</a>, or follow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Typhoon2k\">@Typhoon2k</a> on Twitter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in the Philippines. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>. You can find more information on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/\">Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (<abbr title=\"Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology\">PHIVOLCS</abbr>) website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanoes\">Volcanoes</h3>\n\n<p>There are numerous volcanoes in the Philippines, any of which can erupt without warning. Sudden steam and ash explosions may happen at any time.</p>\n\n<p>On 8 June 2023, the Philippine authorities raised the alert level of Mayon Volcano from level 2 (increasing unrest) to level 3 (increased tendency towards a hazardous eruption).</p>\n\n<p>Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to any areas around volcanoes. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there\u2019s increased risk of lava flows.</p>\n\n<p>You can find more information about volcanoes on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/\">Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (<abbr title=\"Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology\">PHIVOLCS</abbr>)</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Entry into Taal Volcano Island and Taal\u2019s Permanent Danger Zone is prohibited. You should follow updates on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/index.php/taal-volcano-bulletin-menu/\">PhiVolcs official website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ivhhn.org/\">affect air quality and have an impact on health</a>. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection.</p>\n\n<p>The Philippine emergency and rescue services have a limited capacity to deal with large natural disasters.</p>\n\n",

Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Our ability to offer consular support within this region is extremely limited, and in the event of military action on/near the border with Ukraine, would be further reduced. From 28 February, all checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region have temporarily closed. All other border crossings into Moldova remain open. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>On 7 June, the Transnistrian de facto parliament gave greater powers for prosecutions and pre-trial detentions against those regarded as \u201cextremists\u201d. The de facto authorities interpret \u201cextremism\u201d in a way that includes many activities that British nationals would consider legitimate, including moderate protest or freedom of expression.

You should not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Moldova. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>The UK is supporting the multilateral humanitarian effort, led by UNHCR, and also offering practical bilateral support.  If you or your organisation are considering providing humanitarian support to Ukrainians in Moldova, check information on existing support and ways to assist further on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ukstandswithukraine.campaign.gov.uk/\">GOV.UK</a> and the official pages from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dopomoga.gov.md\">Moldovan Government</a> (largely Romanian and Russian only).

We will update this Travel Advice when that changes.</p>\n\n<p>Since autumn 2022 there have been regular political demonstrations in central Chisinau, and occasionally elsewhere. These are likely to continue. They have been small in scale, and generally peaceful and well-policed. Since February 2023, there have been reports and evidence of organised attempts by certain groups to use such demonstrations as a cover for causing disturbances. You are advised to stay away from all political demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against those who overstay. See <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant to petty crime, particularly in Chisinau. Leave your passport, travel documents and other valuable items in a safe place, and carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>There are strong penalties for possession or use of drugs. Avoid taking photographs of military or government installations.

All border crossing points with Romania are also fully operational.  You should check with your airline provider before booking tickets and travelling and be aware that new security protocols are currently in place at Chisinau International Airport, following a recent spate of bomb hoax e-mails. For information, Iasi Airport (Romania) flies directly to the UK and is situated 150km from Chisinau (3 hour drive).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Moldova before travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-moldova-from-ukraine\">Entering Moldova from Ukraine</h3>\n\n<p>All COVID-19 entry requirements have been removed, for Moldovans and foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-moldova-from-all-other-countries\">Entering Moldova from all other countries</h3>\n\n<p>No COVID-19 documentation is required to enter Moldova.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-your-passport-and-travel-documents-before-you-travel\">Check your passport and travel documents before you travel</h2>\n\n<p>You should check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months and have at least one unused page.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>Visas are not required to enter Moldova if your stay is under 90 days. For all other types of visa, contact the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://regatulunit.mfa.gov.md/en\">Embassy of the Republic of Moldova in London</a>. See below for information on entry into Moldova.</p>\n\n<p>As a visitor you are allowed to spend no more than 90 days in any six months period in Moldova. At any official point of entry, your arrival date will be registered automatically. The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against foreign visitors who overstay the terms of their visas. See below for details of entry through Transnistria.</p>\n\n<p>Residence and/or work permits are required for stays over 90 days. Immigration, residence, and work permits usually need to be extended annually, but can be issued for up to five years. Alternatively, you must regularise your stay by applying for a residence or work visa.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings-with-ukraine-and-romania\">Border crossings with Ukraine and Romania</h3>\n\n<p>You should check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine and Romania on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.border.gov.md/index.php/en/\">Moldovan Border Police website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entry-into-moldova-via-transnistria\">Entry into Moldova via Transnistria</h3>\n\n<p>The FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.</p>\n\n<p>On 28 February, all checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region were temporarily closed. We do not know when they will reopen. All other border crossings into Moldova remain open.</p>\n\n<p>The train service between Odessa and Chisinau is suspended until further notice.\nIf you have recently arrived in Moldova via Transnistria you should regularise your stay at the Bureau for Migration &amp; Asylum in Chisinau (124 Stefan cel Mare Bulevard) within 3 days of your arrival. Alternatively, you should go to the local offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum located in: H\u00eerbov\u0103\u021b in Anenii Noi; Hajumus in C\u0103u\u0219eni; P\u00eer\u00eeta in Dub\u0103sari, Criuleni in Criuleni, Rezina in Rezina and S\u0103r\u0103t\u0103uac \u00een Flore\u0219ti.</p>\n\n<p>To register your stay you must present the following documents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your passport</li>\n  <li>proof of travel (for example a Green Card if you drive a vehicle into Moldova; air/ bus/train ticket)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Failure to register may result in fines and difficulties when leaving Moldova.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entry-into-moldova-via-ukraine\">Entry into Moldova via Ukraine</h3>\n\n<p>If you enter Moldova overland from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova (excluding the Transnistria segment) and Ukraine in the north and south of the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entry-into-transnistria\">Entry into Transnistria</h3>\n\n<p>The FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria. Checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region closed on 28 February. We do not know when they will reopen.</p>\n\n<p>There are no \u2018immigration controls\u2019 in place on the internal boundary between the Transnistria region and Moldova and entry stamps won\u2019t be placed into passports. But on entering Transnistria you will be required to fill in 2 copies of a migration card, one of which should be retained and produced on exit. You may also be questioned on the aim of your visit, duration and where you will stay.</p>\n\n<p>You should check ahead that the relevant border crossings are open and roads on the Ukrainian side are fully operational. This is particularly important around Transnistria which is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities.</p>\n\n",

If possible, avoid using public transport, shared taxis, or walking around after dark. On bridges to and from the Le Plateau areas of Abidjan, pedestrians have been attacked and robbed even during the day. Avoid displaying your wallet; for instance, have money to hand to tip supermarket trolley attendants. Attacks by armed robbers have occurred on the main road between Yamoussoukro, Bouak\u00e9 and Korhogo.

Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be in bad mechanical condition. Red taxis, which can be hailed on the street tend to be for private use and yellow ones are shared. Caution is advised with shared taxis and try to avoid using them after dark. Online taxi booking services operate in Abidjan. Wear a seat belt at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks-and-checkpoints\">Roadblocks and checkpoints</h3>\n\n<p>You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan.

The law includes offences of secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country, all of which can be interpreted broadly and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Both individuals and organisations can face prosecution under the NSL.</p>\n\n<p>The NSL applies to activities conducted both inside and outside Hong Kong, which includes activities conducted in the UK. The National Security Law applies to all individuals irrespective of nationality or residency. Hong Kong\u2019s National Security Police have issued arrest warrants and financial rewards against individuals living outside Hong Kong, including in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Under the National Security Law, there is a possibility of being detained and removed to mainland China for some offences. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/english/gazette/volume.php?year=2020&amp;vol=24&amp;no=48&amp;extra=1&amp;type=0\">English translation of the legislation</a> is available online.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that issuing or supporting political statements critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities, including online and on social media, could be viewed as a crime under the NSL and may lead to prosecution in Hong Kong. Those who support individuals who themselves are deemed to be conducting activities in contravention of the National Security Law could also face prosecution under the same law.</p>\n\n<p>The Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance came in force on 1 August 2021. It contains powers that could prevent people from leaving the Hong Kong SAR. The Hong Kong SAR Government has given undertakings that such powers will not be used and that the ability to remove people from flights will be applied only to stop certain asylum seekers from entering Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>Hong Kong, like other parts of China, does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter Hong Kong on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The FCDO has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so.</p>\n\n<p>There are on the spot fines for littering and spitting.</p>\n\n<p>The import and re-export of all elephant ivory and its products, including tourist souvenirs, is banned. Offenders could face a fine and/or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. From 1 February 2023 this includes Cannabidiol (CBD). Possession of these drugs can lead to imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t take photographs of military installations. Since the 1997 handover, the defence of Hong Kong has been the responsibility of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). All previous British military barracks now belong to the PLA.</p>\n\n<p>The Hong Kong SAR Government has restrictions in place on the quantity of powdered baby formula allowed for persons departing the territory. Penalties for non-compliance are severe. See: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/home/index.html\">Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department website</a></p>\n",

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.  Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-demonstrations\">Political demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations sometimes take place in Montenegro, often in front of government or religious buildings. They are mostly peaceful but can lead to traffic disruption, clashes with police and the potential for violent incidents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings from street crime. Do not leave valuables unattended. Use a hotel safe if possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of violent crime between organised criminal groups can happen. Be cautious, remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. In the event of any incidents, follow all advice given by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry a valid form of ID e.g. a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Drugs laws are similar to the UK. There are strict penalties and lengthy prison sentences for possession of or trafficking of drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Taking photographs of police or military installations, personnel or vehicles is illegal and could lead to arrest and prosecution by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>While there is a general tolerance towards same-sex couples in Montenegro, LGBT+ travellers should be aware that showing affection in public, for example, could result in unwanted attention due to the conservative nature of society in Montenegro. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have the appropriate licence and insurance when renting outdoor activity vehicles, such as jet skis and quad bikes. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re hiking in the mountains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>get expert advice from local guides</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>don\u2019t underestimate the hike, factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>take a fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hikers have got lost in the mountains when they have left marked paths.

The 2-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro\u2019s coastal areas are in better condition but can be overcrowded during the summer season.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"traffic-laws\">Traffic laws</h3>\n\n<p>Exceeding the speed limit by 10kph will get you a fine, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from 20 to 6,000 euros. Prison sentences can also be imposed.</p>\n\n<p>If you are issued with a fine, you may be able to pay the police officer by credit card, if the police vehicle is equipped with a POS terminal.  If not, you should go to a bank or post office to pay the fine within 8 days and before leaving the country. Unpaid fines for foreign nationals are recorded on a database.  If you wish to appeal, you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty of causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cartraveldocs.com/european-accident-statement\">European accident report</a> and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are sailing to Montenegro, enter only at a designated port or harbour.

Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen. The last serious earthquake was in 1979.

We advise any British Nationals who remain in CAR to remain vigilant and to limit non-essential movements. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Detention by police forces and armed groups is a common occurrence, primarily for CAR nationals, but also for expatriates.

There are also armed patrols in Bangui and you will encounter several roadblocks (official and unofficial) that are likely to be manned by armed personnel. Take particular care when approaching these and travel in groups if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Security conditions outside of Bangui are extremely unstable. There have been recent incidents of rebel activity, banditry and hostage-taking across the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Worsening inflation, fuel shortages and food insecurity are aggravating causes of crime. Incidents of theft and robbery occur regularly and armed gangs are known to operate in the outlying areas of Bangui. Take personal security precautions and be vigilant in public places. Avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewellery in public. Do not walk alone at night. Avoid isolated or poorer areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in CAR, please note that 1926 and 1949 IDPs will not be accepted. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. It may be extremely difficult to obtain an IDP in CAR. FCDO recommends buying one in the UK before departure.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are poorly maintained and most need a four-wheel drive vehicle. Road travel is particularly difficult during the wet season (May to November). If you do decide to travel by road, you should keep a private supply of fuel if possible and carry supplies with you if travelling outside Bangui.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal roadblocks operate in remote areas. You may be forced to hand over money or possessions in order to continue your journey. There have been indiscriminate and violent attacks on travellers in remote areas. Vehicles have been fired on, and passengers killed or injured. In many of these cases, victims have been robbed or taken hostage and vehicles taken or burnt.</p>\n\n<p>Seek local advice before travelling and FCDO recommends that you do not travel after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Following the constitutional referendum which took place in July 2023, there is an increased risk of social unrest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in the CAR as there is no British Embassy.

If you\u2019re staying longer or living in country, you will need to get a local licence. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is on the right. If you are involved in a major road traffic accident you must stay with your vehicle and call the Royal Oman Police (ROP) on 9999. If you are involved in a minor accident, it may not be necessary to call the police, but you must follow the procedures set out on the ROP website. You must keep a Minor Road Traffic Accident form in your car. You can get one from your insurance company. Car rental companies are responsible for keeping forms in their cars.</p>\n\n<p>Driving can be dangerous outside Muscat; there is a risk of hitting wandering camels and goats on the road. Rainfall can cause sudden and severe flooding in dry riverbeds and on roads that cross them.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of Omani roads is generally good. Driving standards in Oman are not always as disciplined as those in the UK, and the rate of traffic accidents in Oman is significantly higher.</p>\n\n<p>The Omani authorities strictly enforce traffic laws, and there are strong punishments for traffic offences, including fines of up to OMR3000 or jail sentences of up to three years. Seatbelts must be worn by all passengers in a vehicle, and child car seats are mandatory for all children under 4 years of age. It\u2019s illegal to use a mobile phone whilst driving. There\u2019s zero tolerance towards drink-driving. Speed limits are clearly posted on major roads.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert and mountains can be dangerous unless you are in an adequately equipped 4x4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone (or satellite phone) and leave a copy of your travel plans with friends or relatives. You should also make sure you\u2019re insured.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf of Aden are restricted. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, sometimes resulting in arrests. You should make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports. You should also consider how regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>The safety of tourist boats may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>On 18 October 2023 a small peaceful demonstration took place outside the British Embassy. There\u2019s a possibility of further unannounced demonstrations throughout the country. You should continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds.</p>\n\n<p>Developments in the Middle East continue to have an impact on local public opinion. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow the advice of the local authorities, news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which might trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Reported cases of sexual assault against foreign nationals are low. Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. Take care when walking or travelling alone, particularly at night.  You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK.

You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don\u2019t offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Eating, drinking, smoking, playing loud music and dancing in public places during daylight hours of Ramadan is strictly forbidden and punishable by law, including for non-Muslims.  See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Carry a copy of your passport, or your Omani ID if you are a resident, at all times for identification and keep the original document in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>If you are arrested, you may be required to take a blood test \u2013 particularly if the authorities suspect you have used drugs or alcohol. Failure to do so could result in additional charges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>You should dress modestly in public areas including shopping malls. Clothes should cover the tops of the arms and legs (below the knee), and underwear should not be visible.</p>\n\n<p>Wearing tight-fitting clothes is likely to attract attention. You should not wear swimming attire in public areas, except on tourist beaches or at swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-dressing is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-and-e-cigarettes\">Alcohol and e-cigarettes</h3>\n\n<p>Non-Muslim residents can get a licence to drink alcohol at home from the Royal Oman Police. Liquor licenses are not available to non-residents, but it is possible for tourists and visitors to buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. The legal age for drinking alcohol is 21.</p>\n\n<p>It is a punishable offence under Omani law to drink alcohol in public, be drunk in a public area or to drink drive. British nationals have been arrested and charged, including in cases where they have come to the attention of the police for a related offence or matter, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour. Passengers in transit through Omani ports whilst under the influence of alcohol may also be arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Import and use of e-cigarettes/vape products are illegal in Oman.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"offensive-behaviour\">Offensive behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures (including while driving or on social media) are considered obscene acts.</p>\n\n<p>Excessive public displays of affection are frowned upon and may bring you to the attention of the police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography</h3>\n\n<p>Photography of certain government buildings and military sites isn\u2019t allowed. Don\u2019t photograph people without their permission. Hobbies like bird watching and plane spotting may be misunderstood - particularly near military sites, government buildings and airports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-investigations\">Criminal investigations</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud, bouncing cheques, unpaid debt and the non-payment of bills (including hotel bills) can result in imprisonment and/or a fine.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals must pay all outstanding debts and traffic fines before leaving the country. You can pay fines at the airport. If you haven\u2019t paid fines before you leave you may experience delays or be prevented from leaving the country. The same goes if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings or are a child subject to a custody dispute.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visa-overstay\">Visa overstay</h3>\n\n<p>You could be fined and/or detained if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency. You can be fined up to OMR10 per day up to a maximum of OMR500 for overstaying.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences. The penalties for importing, trafficking, smuggling and possession, of even residual amounts, of drugs are severe. In some cases, the death penalty could apply. There is no distinction in Omani law between \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019 drugs; both are treated with equal severity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pornography\">Pornography</h2>\n\n<p>It is illegal to create, import and/or share pornographic images and videos, even if created for personal use and with the consent of those involved.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drones\">Drones</h2>\n\n<p>Flying drones or remote-controlled flying devices either without a valid licence or in restricted airspace is against the law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unmarried-couples\">Unmarried couples</h2>\n\n<p>It\u2019s against the law to live together or share the same hotel room with someone of the opposite sex to whom you aren\u2019t married or closely related.</p>\n\n<p>You may struggle to register the birth of a baby born in Oman if you are unmarried or in a relationship the Omani authorities do not recognise as marriage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"same-sex-relationships\">Same-sex relationships</h3>\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Oman.

There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious events and celebrations, such as the month of Ramadan.\u00a0 The security situation in Afghanistan is volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attacks throughout Afghanistan, including around airports.</p>\n\n<p>See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous and border crossings may not be open.

The British Government may not be notified about such detentions\u00a0 and there are considerable challenges in securing consular contact or access. You \u00a0may not be able to contact your next of kin and detention may be lengthy without clarity being given to your charge. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security#detention\">Detention</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are no British consular officials in Afghanistan and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan. If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to \u00a0your safety and security from staying there. The situation could change quickly and without warning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should keep a low profile. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national in Afghanistan and need to speak to a consular officer, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>call the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0on 020 7008 5000 (available 24 hours a day)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Afghanistan&amp;post=Afghanistan%20travel%20advice%20team\">submit an enquiry</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>contact us on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FCDOtravelGovUK\">Twitter</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/FCDOTravel\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national in Afghanistan, and would like information about applying for UK visas for your family then visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk\">www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like information about applying for a British passport, or would like to check on your passport application, then visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">www.gov.uk/overseas-passports</a> or call the passport advice line on +44 (0) 300 222 0000.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Because the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Afghanistan, your travel insurance may not apply there.

If you are a British national and you are detained in Afghanistan, you could face months or years of imprisonment. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan. The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s ability to secure information from the authorities could also be severely limited and you may not be able to contact your next of kin.</p>\n\n<p>The British government will have very limited ability to help you if you get into difficulty in Afghanistan. If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to \u00a0your safety and security from staying \u00a0there.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should not rely on previous experience of travelling in Afghanistan or previous understanding of rules, laws and society. British nationals with previous experience of operating in Afghanistan have been detained in the country since August 2021.</p>\n\n<p>If you are found in possession of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>weapons</li>\n  <li>explosives</li>\n  <li>tracking devices</li>\n  <li>items that may be considered unusual</li>\n  <li>large quantities of money</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you have worked in the military</li>\n  <li>you have connections to previously detained British nationals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Taliban are likely to suspect you of spying and may detain you. If you are found guilty of espionage or working to undermine Afghanistan\u2019s national security, the punishment may be execution. The Taliban are suspicious of foreigners working or travelling in Afghanistan, including humanitarian workers and journalists, and it\u2019s likely your work and movements will be closely monitored.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals have been detained in Afghanistan without due process. Detention can be lengthy, damaging to health and welfare, and of uncertain outcome. You should avoid any activity which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change in Afghanistan through violence, or any activity inciting violence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sensitive-sites-and-using-cameras\">Sensitive sites and using cameras</h2>\n\n<p>You may come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with people who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs, including of locations or people that may not appear sensitive. It may not be immediately clear when taking photos could cause offence or suspicion. Avoid photographing local people without their agreement and pay close attention to local information and ways of doing things. Photographing certain buildings in Afghanistan is not allowed and may lead to detention, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>government buildings</li>\n  <li>military installations</li>\n  <li>palaces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests\">Protests</h2>\n\n<p>The current conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to protests in Afghanistan that may turn violent. Be vigilant, avoid demonstrations and take appropriate security precautions. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Human trafficking is illegal. Under the UK Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence to offer, promise or give bribes anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Afghanistan is now under Taliban control.</p>\n\n<p>People have been detained for involvement in demonstrations and for activities perceived as dissent.  Foreigners\u2019 activities are viewed with suspicion. You should not do anything which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly. Keep up to date with developments about the security situation, including through monitoring local media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>The situation at Afghanistan\u2019s border crossings remains volatile.  A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. There have been clashes between Afghan and neighbouring forces at various border crossings.</p>\n\n<p>We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are no Afghan airlines that meet UK safety standards. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Afghanistan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">terrorism</a>\u00a0while abroad.</p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious events and celebrations, such as the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaida (AQ), Daesh Khorasan Province (ISKP) and other militant groups have an active presence in Afghanistan. These groups hold strong anti-western views which could make any British interest or person a target. Daesh (ISKP) continues to be a serious threat and is fiercely hostile to the UK, other western countries and some religious minority communities. Daesh (ISKP) and other groups also target NGOs and humanitarian organisations.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should be aware terrorists have a strong desire to target public places frequented by foreigners. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions. An attack on Kabul International Airport in August 2021 killed at least 183 people. Further attacks against aviation and/or airports are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>In trying to target foreigners, restaurants and hotels (such as the Serena in Kabul) could be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh (ISKP) have claimed attacks\u00a0in a variety of locations such as hospitals, schools, places of worship, government, military and security establishments. Historically, government ministries (official buildings and agencies such as passport offices) have been targeted. Diplomatic premises may be attacked to undermine Taliban claims of security.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that terrorists will continue with their tactic of planning attacks at busy and congested times of day, potentially coinciding with local or religious events or celebrations. In the past this has included attacks against schools, market places, religious minorities - including targeting Shia sites, communities and districts.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks in Afghanistan include roadside and suicide bombs either on foot or by vehicle, indirect rocket and mortar fire, direct fire (including shootings and rocket propelled grenades) as well as kidnappings and violent crime. Further attacks are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Afghanistan, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly. Keep others, including family and friends, informed of your travel plans. You are strongly encouraged to avoid setting regular patterns of travel and behaviour making yourself the target of an attack.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>There is a very high threat of being kidnapped in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001; a number of them have been British nationals.  Some foreign nationals remain in captivity.</p>\n\n<p>The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. If you chose to go to Afghanistan against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

See our guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travelling-during-ramadan\">travelling during Ramadan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Taliban have decreed codes of behaviour and dress for both men and women and these codes can be strictly enforced. In public places women are expected to be fully covered, including their faces. Their bodies, arms and legs must be concealed by loose clothing, their hair covered with a headscarf and a veil must cover their face. Men are expected to dress modestly and should remain sensitive to Islamic culture. This includes not wearing clothing items such as sleeveless shirts or shorts.</p>\n\n<p>The Taliban have also decreed that women are not permitted to move around Afghanistan or travel without being accompanied by a mahram, (a husband, father or brother).

A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\u00a0\">EHIC</abbr> does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment.

You should take sensible precautions and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times. Avoid displaying jewellery or items that may attract criminals. Do not leave your drinks unattended, practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events. Overnight visitors should also make sensible extra checks when booking properties, such as asking about local security provision and surrounding street lighting.

There was a general election on 24 June 2023. However, the political situation can change and protests can turn violent. Avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations and comply with any curfews or restrictions put in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Sierra Leone are incident free, but a small number of incidents have been reported of British nationals being robbed, sometimes at knife-point. These incidents were reported in the areas of Congo Cross, Wilkinson Road, Lumley Beach and Aberdeen.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest risk to short-stay travellers is from pick pocketing and mugging in Freetown. If you\u2019re staying for a longer period, make sure your property is secured properly and employ guards.</p>\n\n<p>You should take the following precautions against crime:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid crowds and political demonstrations</li>\n  <li>don\u2019t display or carry expensive items or large sums of money</li>\n  <li>avoid walking alone after dark</li>\n  <li>plan your transport arrangements and minimise use of public transport, taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) and Ocadas (motorbikes). Some robberies have been carried out by associates of the drivers and other passengers.</li>\n  <li>familiarise yourself with your surroundings and remain vigilant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-crime\">Reporting crime</h3>\n<p>The Sierra Leone Police levy a fee for all foreign nationals who need a police report. They are unable to issue crime reference numbers without a police report. You should make your payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund Account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt. Don\u2019t pay the Sierra Leone Police direct.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to report a crime but do not need a crime reference number or a written report, there will be no charge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel\u00a0</h2>\n<p>If you travel outside the Freetown peninsula, try to complete your travel during the hours of daylight, inform your employers of your whereabouts and make sure they have copies of your itinerary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-freetown-from-the-airport\">Travel to Freetown from the airport</h3>\n<p>Lungi airport is situated on the far side of a wide estuary from Freetown. There are several transfer options, including by road, ferry, water taxi and local boats or pirogues. British High Commission staff operate a policy of informed choice and use all of the transport options available, with the exception of local boats (such as the local canoes and wooden pirogues).</p>\n\n<p>The two main water taxi operators run reliable services between Freetown and Lungi. Services are scheduled to align with flight arrivals and departures, with a journey time of around 25 minutes on the water. Check the times before you travel. They can also be privately chartered if you miss your crossing, though this will be more expensive. Water taxis have navigational aids, night lights and provide life jackets for passengers. They have limited rescue capability.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a ferry that operates between Lungi Tagrin and Kissy Town (in the eastern end of Freetown). The journey time is around one hour on the water. The service operates on an ad hoc basis. You should pre-plan your onward journey from there, particularly if you\u2019re arriving at night. The service offers a crossing for both foot passengers and vehicles. The ferry lacks basic safety equipment. Foreign foot passengers have reported being pick-pocketed.</p>\n\n<p>Local boats/pirogues operate without lights and any safety equipment. You should avoid using these craft.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (May to October) rough sea conditions may lead to delays or cancellations. If you choose to cross the estuary, it\u2019s good practice to notify a reliable contact of your departure and expected arrival times and agree what action they will take if you don\u2019t arrive at the expected time.</p>\n\n<p>The journey time by road is normally 3 hours. You should prearrange pick-up as there are no car hire facilities at the airport.  You can contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-freetown\">Consular section at the British High Commission Freetown</a> for a list of Freetown-based car hire companies. British High Commission staff don\u2019t use this option for travel after dark, and rarely use it in daytime due to the risk of road traffic accidents.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to stay at an airport hotel, book early as rooms are extremely limited and in high demand.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive on your UK licence for up to one month, or with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> for the length of its validity. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Sierra Leone, you\u2019ll need to get a Sierra Leone driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Plan your journeys outside Freetown, travel in convoy if possible and report your progress. Have a plan for what to do and where to go in case of emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you use well maintained vehicles. Erratic driving is common and motorbikes are a particular problem. Most roads have little or no lighting and have hazards like vehicles with no lights, wandering pedestrians and animals. Serious traffic accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>Children will sometimes put a rope across the road and ask for a small donation for mending the road. These incidents are most common at the weekend and on roads to tourist beaches in the Western Area. The rope will be lifted if you indicate that you don\u2019t intend to stop. You can distinguish them from official police checkpoints, which are manned by uniformed officers with marked barriers.</p>\n\n<p>British High Commission staff avoid road travel outside the Freetown peninsula during night hours.</p>\n\n<p>British High Commission staff do not use local taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) or ocadas (motorbikes).</p>\n\n<p>Travellers are advised to exercise caution and be prepared for disruption and potential short notice closure of the Guinea-Sierra Leone border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents in Sierra Leone can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9L\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a>\u00a0of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Sierra Leone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n<p>Sierra Leone has many attractive beaches, but strong currents exist at some. Seek local advice about conditions. There are no lifeguards. Swimming is at your own risk. Beware of hospital waste, including needles, on Lumley beach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"services-and-utilities\">Services and utilities</h2>\n<p>No mobile network provides country-wide coverage. Some areas have no mobile reception. There\u2019s no public telephone system and landline connections are poor. It is not possible to call a Sierra Leone mobile phone from a Sierra Leone landline and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Mains water is limited. Power is improving but remains unreliable. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.</p>\n\n",

If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>The World Health Organisation declared Sierra Leone Ebola transmission free in March 2016.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned that you might have been exposed to Ebola, or are showing symptoms, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you\u2019re in the UK call NHS on 111. You should also follow the health advice on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ebola-virus/pages/ebola-virus.aspx\">NHS Choices website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Sierra Leone, especially whilst on business, you should stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you\u2019re in the country, and if you should wish to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Rabies, Lassa fever, water-borne diseases, malaria and other tropical diseases are common to Sierra Leone. In November 2019, an outbreak of Lassa fever was reported in Tonkolili region of Sierra Leone. As of March 2022, a total of 20 cases of Lassa fever, with 11 deaths, have been reported since January 2022. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/195/sierra-leone#General_information\">TravelHealthPro website</a> for more information. If you are concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>Cholera is endemic in Sierra Leone with outbreaks, particularly during the rainy season, in areas where there is poor sanitation. You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2016 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated that around 67,000 people in Sierra Leone were living with HIV. You should exercise precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n",

Do not stop in front of the Palace or drive close to the guards. Do not use this road at night.

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should check the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Check how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
