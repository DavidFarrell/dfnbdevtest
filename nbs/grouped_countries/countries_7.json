However, since September 2022, the level of gun crime on  Providenciales, the first point of arrival into the Turks and Caicos Islands for most visitors and the territory\u2019s economic hub, has been significantly higher than normal in concentrated known hotspots, mainly away from tourist areas. Whilst risks are lower in tourist areas you should take local advice and be aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime tends to be as a result of opportunistic burglary and theft, although an increase in more serious robberies against individuals has been reported. Victims of robberies may suffer injuries if they resist. Safeguard your possessions and take normal precautions to ensure your personal safety, including when using ATM machines, especially at night. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and valuables. Take particular care of your passport as this can\u2019t be replaced locally. Use hotel safety deposit facilities where possible. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community-Organization/Crime-Stoppers-Turks-Caicos-107118949344740/\">Turks and Caicos crime-stoppers</a> website for more crime prevention tips.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you go to isolated spots or remote islands, or go diving/snorkelling, leave details of your trip and an expected time of return with a friend, relative, or hotel receptionist.  Avoid isolated spots and unlit roads at night.</p>\n\n<p>Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations on the principal islands. Charges may be applied per person.  Clarify the fare with the driver before beginning a journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive using a British Driving Licence or an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/\">International Driving Permit</a> for a period of one month. After this you should get a local licence from the Department of Road Safety.</p>\n\n<p>Most hire cars and jeeps are imported from the US and so are left-hand drive even though driving is on the left (as in the UK). Remember to drive on the left. Observe speed limits (20mph in town, and 40mph elsewhere). Don\u2019t drink and drive. Use seat belts on all journeys. Accidents, sometimes serious, are on the increase on the Leeward Highway (Providenciales), especially at night. Be aware of cyclists and, even, cars driving at night without lights.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-assistance\">Emergency assistance</h3>\n<p>The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British Overseas Territory so does not have formal British consular representation.

Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Turks and Caicos Islands as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. No cases of Zika infection have been reported in Turks and Caicos Islands since January 2017. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/229/turks-and-caicos-islands#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/229/turks-and-caicos-islands#Other_risks\">dengue fever</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/104/chikungunya-virus-caribbean-and-the-americas\">chikungunya virus</a>  have been confirmed in the Turks and Caicos Islands. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. For more details about this outbreak, see the website of the National Health Network and Centre.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n<p>There are hospital facilities on Providenciales and Grand Turk, both operated by Interhealth Canada. They provide a range of services including diagnostic services, primary care and outpatient specialty clinics, emergency services and inpatient care. Serious cases are still referred overseas, usually to Miami or Nassau. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to obtain further supplies of your prescribed medicine whilst you are in the Turks and Caicos Islands, you will firstly need to visit a registered physician, who will either countersign your UK prescription or issue a new one.  It is likely that you will have to pay for your medical appointment and the full costs of your medicine up front then submit a claim for reimbursement through your travel insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies on all islands are usually well stocked, however less common medication may only be available in the hospital or pharmacies on Providenciales.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

More protests could be called at short notice. Previous protests in Kenya have resulted in clashes between the police and demonstrators resulting in deaths and injuries. Avoid protests and political gatherings. Protests can occur in different places, be alert to media coverage and if you see a large crowd move away from the area. Some workplaces and schools may be closed on\u00a0days of demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover.

Attacks, including terrorist kidnappings, could target Westerners, including British nationals. Attacks could occur at any time, including around religious or other public holidays or celebrations.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate in places frequented by foreigners including hotels, bars, restaurants, sports bars and nightclubs, sporting events, supermarkets, shopping centres, commercial buildings, coastal areas including beaches, government buildings including Embassies, airports, buses, trains and other transport hubs. Places of worship including churches and mosques have also been targeted. British nationals are advised to be particularly vigilant in these areas and to consider whether there are effective local security arrangements in place (e.g bag searches, physical security, guards). You should avoid regular patterns of movement and aim to travel during daylight hours.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/kenya/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There are frequent incidents of violent crime including mugging, armed robbery and carjacking, particularly in the large cities.

A copy of your passport is normally acceptable, but recently some police officers have been insisting on the original document.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Bag snatching is common in transport hubs like bus stations, railway stations and airports. Mugging, kidnapping, car-jacking and armed robbery occur regularly, particularly in Nairobi, Mombasa and other large cities. In Nairobi, risk of these crimes is higher in Eastleigh, Central Business District, Mathare, Kibera and slum areas. In Mombasa, crime rates are higher in the Old Town and on and around the Likoni Ferry (which links Mombasa and the southern resorts). Although uncommon, incidents of violent crime have resulted in the death of several British nationals. Gun attacks in Kwale County on the south coast resulted in fatalities in September and October 2017.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times and take into account any security advice given by your hotel, employer or your hosts. If you\u2019re attacked, don\u2019t resist. Avoid walking around after dark, especially in isolated areas like empty beaches. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don\u2019t wear expensive watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of thieves posing as police officers or private Security Guards. Always ask to see identification. Don\u2019t accept food or drink from strangers as it may be drugged.</p>\n\n<p>Only stay in tourist camps with good perimeter security. If in any doubt, seek advice from your tour operator or the Kenya Tourism Federation (telephone: + 254 20 800100).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in any security incident, insist that the British High Commission is informed straight away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h3>\n<p>Avoid protests and political gatherings. Protests can occur in different places, be alert to media coverage and if you see a large crowd move away from the area.  Some workplaces and schools may be closed on these days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to within 60km of the Kenya-Somali border; to Garissa county; to Lamu county (excluding Lamu Island and Manda Island); to areas of Tana River county north of the Tana river itself and to within 15km of the coast from the Tana river down to the Galana (Athi-Galana-Sabaki) river.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island, you should do so by air to Lamu Airport (a civilian airport on Manda Island) and not by road. The only commercial option for air travel to or from Lamu Island and Manda Island is through Lamu Airport.</p>\n\n<p>For travel between Jomo Kenyatta Airport (JKIA) and Nairobi city you should use the Mombasa road or the Nairobi Expressway. There is a higher risk of car-jacking on the old airport road (Airport South Road) and Jogoo Road. The Mombasa road to JKIA can get very busy during rush hours, and check-in can take several hours; you should allow plenty of time to get to the airport. A new vehicle security check outside JKIA has also added to journey times.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to game reserves and other tourist areas are trouble-free. If you visit reserves, use reputable tour operators and arrive at your destination in daylight hours. Do not buy safari tours from touts. Always follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice.</p>\n\n<p>There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Bathing in rivers and lakes is forbidden in National Parks and is best avoided elsewhere due to the dangers from both wildlife and water-borne disease.</p>\n\n<p>Rural areas, particularly in the north and north eastern parts of Kenya, occasionally experience cattle rustling, banditry and ethnic clashes. Foreigners are not usually the target of localised violence and banditry, but you should take great care in the north and northeast.</p>\n\n<p>The Government of Kenya has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia, and Samburu counties. British nationals travelling in these areas should adhere to local security measures and exercise caution.</p>\n\n<p>Although the border with Somalia has officially been closed since 2007, crossings take place frequently. Landmines have been used in attacks around Moyale, close to the main A2 road south. Vehicles crossing the Kenya-Ethiopia border at this point should stay on the A2. Avoid staying at the rest house at Sololo - travel directly to Marsabit Town before breaking the journey.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of previous armed clashes in the area of Mount Elgon in western Kenya next to the Ugandan border, a large security presence remains and further incidents are possible. Seek local advice before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor local media and take care in all remote areas.  A Safety and Communication Centre operated by the Kenya Tourism Federation gives up to the minute tourist advice as well as providing help in an emergency. You can contact the Centre on +254 20 800100 or by e-mail to: <a href=\"mailto:operations@ktf.co.ke\">operations@ktf.co.ke</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Kenya with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months, or on a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Kenya, you\u2019ll need to get a Kenyan driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. Only hire vehicles from reputable companies.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions and driving standards are often poor.  Drive with windows closed and doors locked. When driving outside cities and in remote areas consider driving in convoy. Avoid driving at night wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving long-distance buses. Vehicles are often poorly maintained and driven at excessive speed. Check the bus operator\u2019s safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>Though very cheap to use, matatus (minibuses) are notorious for being poorly maintained, badly driven and uninsured. There are frequent reports of matatus being hijacked and passengers being robbed.</p>\n\n<p>On the spot fines from traffic police are common, but not legal. If stopped by a police officer you should ask for the due process to be followed. The officer should issue you with a \u2018receipt for cash bond\u2019, a piece of paper telling you when and where you need to attend court to answer the charge against you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Passenger trains run between Nairobi and Mombasa. Take care of your belongings while on the train and at railway stations. If you leave your compartment, take your valuables with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Kenya can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5Y\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are some concerns about the lack of security arrangements in place at Wilson airport in Nairobi. The airport is mainly used for domestic flights, including charters.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to charter a private aircraft, check with the company about the condition of the aircraft and runways to be used. If the company has no Safety Pilot, find another company that does.</p>\n\n<p>Local rules and regulations prohibit photography at airports. You could be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant at all times when transiting airports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>The threat of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea page</a> for more information and advice.</p>\n\n",

Attacks, including terrorist kidnappings, could target Westerners, including British nationals. Attacks could occur at any time, including around religious or other public holidays or celebrations.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate in places frequented by foreigners including hotels, bars, restaurants, sports bars and nightclubs, sporting events, supermarkets, shopping centres, commercial buildings, coastal areas including beaches, government buildings including Embassies, airports, buses, trains and other transport hubs. Places of worship including churches and mosques have also been targeted. British nationals are advised to be particularly vigilant in these areas and to consider whether there are effective local security arrangements in place (e.g bag searches, physical security, guards). You should avoid regular patterns of movement and aim to travel during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorism threat is from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia opposed to the Somali government. Al Shabaab has issued public threats against Kenya due to Kenya\u2019s military intervention in Somalia. The Kenyan authorities have increased security to counter potential reprisal attacks by Al Shabaab. There is some evidence of growing support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>On 8 January 2020 Al Shabaab released a public statement \u2018Kenya Must Take Heed\u2019; this states Al Shabaab intent to attack tourists, including those on safari trips. It also references government institutions and military installations as potential attack targets.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers to Lamu Island and Manda Island should be particularly vigilant given the close proximity of these islands to the Lamu County mainland. On 5 January 2020 Al Shabaab conducted an attack on a military airstrip in Lamu County, killing 3 US personnel. Due to the threat of terrorism, if you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island you should do so by air to Lamu Airport (a civilian airport on Manda Island), and not by road. The only commercial option for air travel to or from Lamu Island and Manda Island is through Lamu Airport.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of other terrorist attacks in Kenya in recent years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 15-16 January 2019 there was an attack at the hotel and commercial complex at 14 Riverside in Nairobi, resulting in injuries and loss of life. One British national was killed.</li>\n  <li>On 2 April 2015 there was an attack on Garissa University College in Garissa County in which at least 148 people were killed.</li>\n  <li>In June and July 2014 attacks in Lamu and Tana River Counties on the Kenyan coast are reported to have killed at least 85 people.</li>\n  <li>On 21-24 September 2013 over 60 people including six British nationals were killed in an attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In particular, there are also frequent attacks in the north-eastern border regions (Lamu, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera Counties), most of which were attributed to Al Shabaab. These have killed members of the Kenyan security forces as well as civilians. The Kenyan security forces have increased their presence in the affected areas. Armed militia groups operate within the Boni Forest and along the border with Somalia.</p>\n\n<p>Kenyan official buildings such as government offices and law enforcement personnel and facilities have been particular targets. Somali government interests in Kenya may also be targeted. Take extra security precautions if you plan on travelling to any of these places.</p>\n\n<p>Further attacks are very likely. Methods of attack have included suicide vests, grenades, knife attacks, shootings and bombings, including car bombings, and improvised explosive devices.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Kenya have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests in recent years. They have also provided extra protection including in areas near to the Somalia border and on the Kenyan coast.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping across Kenya. You should be alert to the heightened threat of terrorist kidnapping targeting Westerners, including British nationals. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps in northern counties, counties bordering Somalia and coastal counties, and further kidnaps are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. On 12 April 2019 two Cuban doctors were kidnapped in Mandera north-east Kenya. Kenyan police suspect Al-Shabaab were behind the attack. On 20 November 2018, an unknown armed gang attacked a trading centre in Chakama in Kilifi County, and abducted an Italian NGO worker. A number of kidnaps have occurred in Dadaab refugee camps in north east Kenya. British aid workers in Kenya should satisfy themselves that those arranging their stay have sufficient security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, first deal with the emergency with first aid skills if possible and then move onto the nearest, largest Accident and Emergency department. In Nairobi this is either Nairobi Hospital or the Aga Khan University Hospital.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h3>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/117/kenya#CIoutBreaks\">Cholera</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/117/kenya#Malaria\">malaria</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/117/kenya#CIoutBreaks\">dengue fever</a> and other insect-borne infections occur in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>In July, the Government of Kenya launched a 10-day yellow fever vaccination campaign targeting Garissa and Isiolo County following an outbreak of the disease in those areas earlier this year. As of 23 July 2022, 111 yellow fever cases, with 12 deaths, have been report in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>You should take precautions to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by insects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 August 2018, an outbreak of Ebola was declared in B\u00e9ni territory, North Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On 11 June 2019, the Ugandan government confirmed an outbreak of Ebola in Kasese District in western Uganda. Kenyan authorities have put in place additional screening measures at some airports and border crossings in Kenya for those arriving from affected areas. The latest updates can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\">WHO</a> website.  If travelling in the region, you should check <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> Travel Advice for the relevant countries.</p>\n\n<p>You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

In most cases a photocopy of the data page of your passport should be enough, but you may also be asked for a second form of photo ID. The police will normally ask for your full passport if you are stopped while driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport-1\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Tickets on public transport must be validated in a ticket machine before you start a journey. Officials patrol public transport and will issue an on the spot fine of 100 to 500 euros (reduced to 50 euros if paid immediately) if you don\u2019t hold a validated ticket.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tourist-tax\">Tourist tax</h3>\n\n<p>Many major cities in Italy impose a small tax on tourists. The tax is paid at your hotel and is usually not included in any pre-paid arrangements or package deal. The rate of tax varies from city to city and can depend on the star rating of the hotel. Hotels often ask for payment in cash. Make sure you get a receipt. For more information, check with the local tourist information office.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h3>\n\n<p>Some Italian towns and cities have specific laws, which you may be fined if you break.

If you do, you can be fined up to 500 euros.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal traders operate on the streets of all major Italian cities. It is illegal to buy items from unlicensed street traders. If you do, you could be stopped by the local police and fined.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to remove sand, shells or pebbles from coastal areas in Italy. Doing so may result in large fines. It\u2019s also forbidden to collect various species of flowers, plants and herbs from mountain and wooded areas. For more information, check with the regional authorities of the area you\u2019re visiting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"winter-sports\">Winter sports</h2>\n\n<p>If you are planning a skiing holiday, take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.italia.it/en/contact-us?\">Italian State Tourist Board</a> for advice on safety and weather conditions before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Regulations for the ski season include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>third party liability insurance is a legal requirement and can be purchased locally with a ski pass</li>\n  <li>you must wear a helmet if you are under 18</li>\n  <li>you must not eat or drink on ski lifts or boarding areas</li>\n  <li>you must not climb a slope with snowshoes unless in a case of emergency</li>\n  <li>you must not ski under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is very dangerous.

For more information about the avalanche risk, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.avalanches.org/\">European Avalanche Warning Service</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Check your insurance covers off-piste activity.

You may want to hire a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-in-italy\">Transport risks in Italy</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Only use officially licensed taxis. These will have a taxi sign on the roof and a taxi company name and number written on the side. Taxis should be called or taken from an official rank rather than hailed in the street.</p>\n\n<p>Transport strikes are often called at short notice. You can find information on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://scioperi.mit.gov.it/mit2/public/scioperi\">Ministry of Transport</a> website (in Italian).</p>\n\n<p>Traffic can be busy, fast and chaotic, especially in the larger cities. Take care when crossing roads. Pedestrians should cross roads using a crossing. You can be fined for crossing the road if you are within 100 metres of a pedestrian crossing but do not use it. Drivers don\u2019t always stop, even though they are required to. The green pedestrian crossing signal also allows cars to turn right onto the crossing, so cross with caution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Italy, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/italy/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You may also want to look at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm\">European Commission</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.theaa.com/european-breakdown-cover/driving-in-europe/country-by-country/italy\">AA</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/view/22479/\">Italian Police</a> guides on driving in Italy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting Italy, you can drive on a full, valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents.

You can buy a pass from most car hire companies. The boundaries of historic centres are usually marked with the letters ZTL in black on a yellow background. If you pass this sign, your registration number is likely to be caught on camera and you will be fined.</p>\n\n<p>There is a congestion charge for Milan city centre. For more information see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.comune.milano.it/\">Milan Municipality website.</a></p>\n\n<p>To reduce pollution, city authorities in Rome sometimes restrict traffic on specific days so vehicles with odd or even number plates are not allowed on the roads in the green band (fascia verde) area, which covers most of Rome.

Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. UK prescriptions are not accepted, though you may be able to buy an equivalent medication from the pharmacy. Alternatively, you can visit an Italian GP to obtain a local prescription. Prescription medicines are not free in Italy, but with an <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr>, and an Italian prescription, you will pay a reduced rate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-and-mental-health\">Travel and mental health</h2>\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-and-wellbeing-abroad\"><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> guidance on travel and mental health</a>.

Flight schedules may be unreliable and may change at short notice. You should consult your airline and/or travel agent.</p>\n\n<p>Road routes are also likely to be restricted by seasonal weather, with the Babusar Pass liable to close due to snowfall.</p>\n\n<p>Options to leave the north of Pakistan may therefore become limited.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before the COVID pandemic there were nearly half a million visits by British nationals to Pakistan. Most visits are trouble free.</p>\n\n<p>In late August 2023, there were large demonstrations and protests in Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan. There remains a risk of protests, which could turn violent, and road closures throughout the region. Gatherings of four or more people are banned and the mobile phone and data network is disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>Political rallies and protests regularly take place across Pakistan. Some may have an anti-western dimension and could turn violent. Tear gas can be used to disperse protests. Avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and political events. Be alert to local news and, where possible, social media and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour company. If you find yourself near protests, turn away and move to a safe place. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan. There\u2019s a high threat of terrorism, kidnap and sectarian violence throughout the country, including the major cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi. Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. You should try to avoid all crowds and public events including political gatherings and religious events throughout Pakistan, and <a href=\"/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">take appropriate security precautions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, hiking trails, airports, infrastructure projects, public transport, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Some periods of the year may pose heightened risks. During holy periods/religious holidays, there is an increased potential for targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan can experience extreme weather, including severe heatwaves. These typically occur between March and June. The extreme temperatures can cause poor air quality, wildfires and power cuts.  You should avoid unnecessary exposure to direct sunlight and take precautionary measures.  More information and detailed guidance is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cms.ndma.gov.pk/\">National Disaster Management Authority website</a>.

Take particular care of your passport, bank cards, bags, jewellery, laptop and mobile, especially on public transport, when travelling to and from the airport and in crowded areas including markets. There is an active black market in forged and stolen passports. Credit card fraud is common.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise caution when moving around urban areas at night, especially if travelling on foot.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals of Pakistani origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals.</p>\n\n<p>Much of Balochistan, northern Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have a high level of lawlessness.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations are common in Pakistan.  You should keep track of the local news. Protests can occur with little warning and while most remain peaceful, they can turn violent and escalate quickly. During elections, political events, rallies and polling stations have been the target of terrorist attacks. You should avoid all political demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events and be prepared to change your plans as necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>The Pakistan authorities currently advise that \u201call foreigners, including diplomats may not move out of their city of residence without proper security and without prior co-ordination with the law enforcement agency\u201d. This requirement has not been rigorously enforced, but you should consider informing local authorities of any travel plans, and be prepared to be stopped and challenged by officials, who may instruct you to turn around.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling in Pakistan, you or your travel company should contact the local authorities of your destination in advance to check the local security situation. They may arrange police protection as necessary and will advise whether you need a No Objection Certificate issued by the Pakistani Ministry of Interior.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise care in selecting accommodation and take precautions to maintain safety and keep a low profile.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>Except for official border crossing points, foreigners are not allowed to travel within certain distances of Pakistan\u2019s international borders. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel to within 5 miles of Pakistan\u2019s border with India and within 10 miles of the Line of Control</li>\n  <li>10 miles of the border with China</li>\n  <li>10 miles of the border with Afghanistan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you travel to these areas you may be arrested and detained.</p>\n\n<p>The situation for border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan may change rapidly due to the security situation in Afghanistan. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Afghanistan or within 10 miles of the Afghan border as well as Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan Province and a number of districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">summary</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"islamabad\">Islamabad</h3>\n<p>Police and security agencies have a significant presence in Islamabad. You should exercise caution in the outlying districts, such as I8, I9, I10 and areas further west, where security forces have conducted operations against suspected criminals and terrorists.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid all protests. Crowded areas such as the Red Mosque (Lal Masjid) and Aabpara Market in G6 have been a focal point for protests in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karachi\">Karachi</h3>\n\n<p>Karachi can be prone to varying levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. Criminal and political violence is common including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by various religious and political parties are capable of causing significant disruption across the city and can occasionally lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller scale labour strikes are also a common occurrence and cause regular disruptions on a more localised scale.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of terrorism throughout the country. On 17 February 2023 militants attacked a police station in the city killing a number of police officers. On 26 April 2022, a suicide bomb at the University of Karachi targeted Chinese nationals and killed 4 people. Public service and health officials have also been subject to attacks in the past whilst delivering health programmes. There is also a risk of violence in parts of the city which include government offices. Major hotels and the financial district are generally regarded as more stable, though there remains a risk of violence, particularly following Friday prayers.</p>\n\n<p>You should carefully plan any travel within the city. You should take advice from hosts or trusted contacts, abide by direction from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans. Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town have a greater risk of violence based on past activity. Exercise heightened vigilance if visiting these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lahore\">Lahore</h3>\n\n<p>Lahore is the capital of Punjab province, and attracts large numbers of tourists and business travellers.  While the city has a widespread police presence, there have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent years. These have targeted public places and government or security forces. You should avoid religious events or gatherings, public events and large crowds of people throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"balochistan\">Balochistan</h3>\n\n<p>There is a significant risk from kidnapping and militant activity in much of Balochistan. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to most of the province (see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">Summary</a>) other than the southern coast of Balochistan where we advise against all but essential travel. The southern coast is defined as the area south of (and including) the N10 motorway as well as the section of the N25 which runs from the N10/N25 intersection to the Balochistan/Sindh border, including the port city of Gwadar.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to visit the southern coast of Balochistan, make sure you have the necessary permission from the authorities and proper security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gilgit-baltistan\">Gilgit-Baltistan</h3>\n\n<p>In late August 2023, there were large-scale religious protests in Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan. There remains a risk of protests, which could turn violent, and road closures throughout the region. Gatherings of four or more people are banned and the mobile phone and data network is disrupted. You should take care to avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and political events.</p>\n\n<p>The terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan is mountainous, with remote and isolated locations that are difficult to police effectively. You are strongly advised to obtain and follow local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements in advance of any visit.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You may need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, in particular for mountains over 6,000 metres. The permission process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you do not have the correct permits.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups. Do not trek alone. Be aware of the risks of altitude sickness.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karakoram-highway\">Karakoram Highway</h3>\n\n<p>The Karakoram Highway runs from Hasan Abdal in north Punjab towards Gilgit and the Chinese border. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel on the Highway between Mansehra and Chilas via Battagram, Besham City, Dasu and Sazin up to the junction with the N15. You should avoid travelling on the Highway at night - the road can be narrow with sudden steep drops. All sections of the Highway north of Batagram up to the Chinese border have experienced landslides.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"khyber-pakhtunkhwa\">Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa</h3>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all travel to much of the province (see\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">Summary</a>). There is military or militant activity in a number of districts. Militant violence is frequent in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  Localised curfews may be imposed at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Arandu District to the south and west of Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is sometimes subject to cross border attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pakistan-administered-kashmir\">Pakistan-administered Kashmir</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel 10 miles of the Line of Control.</p>\n\n<p>Following a terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February 2019, there remain heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly across the Line of Control.</p>\n\n<p>There is regular military activity on the Line of Control. Although a ceasefire has been implemented, there remain significant tensions between India and Pakistan and there is a serious risk of small arms fire (roughly up to 300 metres from the Line) and occasional mortar fire (roughly up to 7 kilometres from the Line).</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to travel. Specific requirements can change and you should check the latest requirements before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"punjab\">Punjab</h3>\n\n<p>If you travel to southern Punjab take advice about the local security situation in advance. There are frequent reports of criminality and public order incidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sindh\">Sindh</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to areas of Sindh Province north of, and including, the city of Nawabshah.\nThere are high levels of lawlessness in the north of Sindh Province with  a very high risk from crime and kidnapping. The area is frequented by criminal gangs or bandits with access to heavy weaponry. On 6 November 2022 a large criminal gang attacked police in Ghotki, northern Sindh, killing several officers and taking others hostage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Pakistan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers travelling on domestic air routes are no longer required to present evidence of COVID-19 vaccination.</p>\n\n<p>Due to recent cases of Mpox (formerly known as Monkey Pox) there may be enhanced screening and preventive measures at points of entry.</p>\n\n<p>There is limited public transport from the Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), but taxi services are available. It is recommended that you only use taxis from reputable, licenced companies that are radio-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>Allow yourself enough time to get through enhanced airport security checks, but do not linger unnecessarily. Be vigilant, follow instructions from security and airport personnel, and contact your airline in the event of any disruption.</p>\n\n<p>Flights into the mountainous areas in the north of Pakistan are frequently delayed or cancelled due to extreme weather.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid using the railway network, which has been subject to terrorist attacks as well as derailments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You should have a <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Pakistan. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted. You can only get IDPs over the counter from selected UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. If you are planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan has a modern and efficient motorway system between the major cities. The quality of other roads is more variable. Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Road conditions can be poor and there is a risk of carjacking.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using street taxis. Only use taxis from reputable, licensed companies which are radio-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>For your safety, you should avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus which operates between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>\n\n<p>The north of Pakistan is mountainous, with some of the highest peaks in the world contained within this area. As a result many roads are inaccessible at certain times of the year due to extreme weather conditions, and landslides frequently block or destroy roads. The N15 Highway between Chilas and Babusar in Gilgit Baltistan is closed at certain times of the year due to weather and is susceptible to landslides.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended that you only use experienced local drivers when traversing these routes and should only attempt to do so in clear weather conditions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>The threat from piracy within 12 nautical miles of the Pakistani coastline is low, but you should be aware of the significant threat piracy poses in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.</p>\n\n",

The main terrorist threat comes from Tehrik-e Taleban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organisation of groups primarily active in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Daesh is also active. While both groups\u2019 activities are primarily directed against the Pakistani state, they have in the past stated an intent to launch attacks on western interests. TTP and Daesh conduct attacks throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Further attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Previous methods of attack have included grenades, shootings, bombings and suicide bombs. Militants can launch complex and deadly attacks. Be vigilant, keep a low profile and vary your routes and timings if you make any regular journeys. You should avoid large organised gatherings which may expose you to higher risk, such as public protests, religious gatherings and processions, and political rallies. Courts and government buildings, security facilities or personnel can also be the target of attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, hiking trails, airports, public transport, infrastructure projects, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. Additionally, take care if you\u2019re planning to attend sporting events or live music venues. Attacks have previously targeted places that could be considered by militants to be un-Islamic, including CD/DVD shops and barber shops. In recent years, the Pakistani authorities have reintroduced major sporting events into the country, including the Pakistan Super League in cricket. Increased security measures are in place at these events. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas, follow the advice of security personnel and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. There may be a higher risk of terrorist incidents during the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistani government personnel and institutions, and the security forces, including police, are prime targets for attacks. Avoid key government installations and gatherings of uniformed personnel, and be vigilant in areas around diplomatic premises throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Places of worship, including churches, religious sites, minority religious sects and shrines are often targeted. You should avoid religious events or gatherings and limit movements on Friday afternoons. During holy periods/religious holidays there may be a higher risk of targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, suffer regular terrorist attacks. There are threats of attacks in Karachi and almost daily violence. Areas of Balochistan, including Quetta experience frequent attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep track of the local news. Incidents can occur and the security situation can deteriorate quickly. There may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping throughout Pakistan. Both terrorists and criminal groups are involved in hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<p>If you are working or travelling in Pakistan, you should be alert to the threat of kidnap targeting Westerners, including British nationals. British nationals of Pakistani origin are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. British and other foreign national kidnap victims have faced extended periods of detention. While some were ultimately released by their captors, others have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business.  If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

During this time,  the following actions may cause offence:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>Playing loud music or dancing in public areas</li>\n  <li>Swearing in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>Be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink during fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>Dress modestly - clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>Be aware that traffic may be unpredictable, and show extra consideration of other drivers</li>\n  <li>Be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may also be a higher risk of terrorist incidents during Ramadan. Avoid large gatherings and exercise caution and remain vigilant at hotels, airports, markets, shopping malls and restaurants. For more information, see our <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/terrorism\">Terrorism section</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"id\">ID</h3>\n<p>You should carry some form of photo ID at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress\">Dress</h3>\n<p>You should dress modestly at all times. Men and women should cover their shoulders and legs when in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques or other holy places, and when travelling in rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n<p>Consumption of alcohol is illegal for Muslims. Public consumption and drunkenness are illegal and can lead to detention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"blasphemy\">Blasphemy</h3>\n<p>Blasphemy is illegal and has a broad definition in Pakistani law. It includes public and private comments in any form, including on social media. The state enforces blasphemy laws and there are significant criminal penalties up to and including the death penalty. In addition, those accused of blasphemy are at significant risk of violence from members of the public. Both Muslims and religious minorities have been victims of blasphemy accusations and violence, including killings. Visitors should therefore be sensitive to religious beliefs and behave accordingly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-proceedings\">Criminal proceedings</h3>\n<p>The death penalty can and has been imposed for crimes including blasphemy, murder, drug offences and rape.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-good\">Importing good</h3>\n<p>Importing alcohol and pork products is illegal. and neither are readily available in Pakistan. Penalties for illegal importation could include detention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h3>\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page for the LGBT community</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h3>\n<p>Cohabitation by an unmarried couple is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n<p>Possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs can lead to imprisonment. A number of British nationals have been arrested on drug trafficking charges and face long periods in detention on remand as their cases make their way through the Pakistan legal system. Drug trafficking can attract the death penalty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular Assistance</h3>\n\n<p>If you or your parents were born in Pakistan, you might be considered a Pakistani national by the local authorities even if you do not hold a Pakistani passport, and the British government may be prevented from providing the full range of consular assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that consular staff are limited by the same travel restrictions as other foreign nationals and therefore may be unable to provide in-person assistance in some areas. However, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/travel-advice-help-and-support\">24 hour remote assistance is available in London on 020 7008 5000.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography</h3>\n<p>Do not take photographs at military establishments, airports or any infrastructure, including bridges and dams including from aircraft.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on imported goods medical supplies may become increasingly hard to find in country. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important.

Any exemption due to a medical condition needs to be supported by a medical certificate issued by recognised health authority.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n\n<p>Local medical facilities are not comparable to those in the UK, especially in remote areas. For psychiatric illness, specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities in Pakistan. Private medical care is available in all major cities, but expensive. The British High Commission Islamabad maintains a list of medical facilities in different cities of Pakistan. You\u2019re strongly advised to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers the duration of your stay in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1122 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to travel to Pakistan with your medicine, please consult <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/\">NHS advice</a> before travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h2>\n<p>You should follow the advice of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/171/pakistan#CIoutBreaks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should take steps to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when purchasing bottled water.

Check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://london.mfa.ir/en\">Iranian Embassy in the UK</a> for more information.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals have had problems getting visas from private online visa agencies.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you submit your visa application.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/107/iran#Vaccine-recommendations\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Iran guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Dual nationals are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities. All Iranian nationals must travel to and from Iran using an Iranian passport.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You may also be required to demonstrate to the Iranian airport authorities that you have the right to enter the UK. You must be able to produce your British passport or a valid UK visa in your Iranian passport on request. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to question you. The Iranian authorities have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"being-considered-an-iranian-national\">Being considered an Iranian national\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Even if you do not consider yourself Iranian, you may be seen as an Iranian national by Iranian authorities.

This is assumed to be the case by Iranian immigration authorities unless the father has petitioned the court, or the court has ruled to prevent the children travelling.

In an emergency, for example if there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it is extremely unlikely that the British government will able to evacuate you or provide face-to-face assistance in Iran. In these situations, it may become more difficult to leave safely. Air, sea and land routes are under the control of the Iranian authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Assume that no face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency situation and that the British government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"arbitrary-arrest-and-detention\">Arbitrary arrest and detention\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There is a very high risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention for British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the authorities to question you. If you\u2019re detained in Iran, you could face months or years of imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a British-Iranian dual national and you are detained in Iran, the authorities will not tell\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202for grant\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0access to see you.\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr> may also not be able to visit you to provide consular support for long periods.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>British-Iranian dual nationals have been arbitrarily detained in Iran and made to serve long prison sentences. In January 2023, a British national was executed after receiving the death penalty. Iran has arrested and detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process in these cases falls below international standards.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re detained in Iran your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who show a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. As a result, consular assistance to British nationals in Iran is extremely limited.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have accused people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are in or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Mass arrests, including of bystanders, happen often. It is difficult to predict where protests will take place, and they may turn violent. British nationals arrested in connection with protests may come under added suspicion of espionage or working to undermine the Iranian government. This can increase the risk of lengthy detention, criminal charges or receiving the death penalty.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You may also come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with Iranians who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Even if you avoid protests and crowds, there is still a very high risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention. In all cases of detention, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fhas serious concerns that the judicial process falls below international standards.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"links-to-the-uk\">Links to the UK\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>While having British connections can be reason enough for the authorities to be suspicious of your activities, you are at even greater risk if you are involved in:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>civil societies (including labour unions, human rights groups or political activist groups)\u00a0</li>\n  <li>journalism\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>academia\u00a0</li>\n  <li>any organisation perceived as anti-Iranian (either within Iran or elsewhere)\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>any institution based in the UK that receives public funds from or which have perceived links to, the British government\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>historic or current social media activism related to protest movements in Iran\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are more at risk during times of terrorist incidents, national unrest, or when there is an increase in tensions between Iran and the international community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Border areas are sensitive. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fadvises all British nationals already residing in Iran against all travel:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 100km of the Iran-Afghanistan border\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>within 10km of the entire Iran-Iraq border\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>to the provinces of Sistan and Baluchistan \u00a0</li>\n  <li>to the area east of Bam and Jask, including Bam\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is risk of banditry in the area east of Bam, Jask, and Sistan and Baluchistan. This is the main route for drug traffickers from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The towns of Zahedan, Zabol and Mirjaveh are particularly insecure.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some Iranian officials and media reports have falsely alleged a UK connection to anti-government groups in Khuzestan, Kurdish-majority regions, and Sistan and Baluchistan. If you travel to these areas against our advice, stick to the main routes to avoid accidentally entering restricted or military zones.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime and petty theft. Avoid carrying large amounts of money and keep your passport safe.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There have been some attacks and robberies targeted at foreigners and tourists, including attempted robberies by thieves posing as policemen, usually in civilian clothing. If you\u2019re approached by anyone who claims to be a policeman, ask to see ID and request the presence of a uniformed officer or marked patrol car. Do not hand over documents or cash, or get into a vehicle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Getting cash in Iran is extremely difficult. Non-Iranian debit and cash cards will not work in Iran. It\u2019s usually not possible to change travellers cheques.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to change money on the street. You can exchange selected foreign currencies in some exchange bureaux, though you may have problems changing money. Euros and US dollars are more commonly accepted than British pounds.</p>\n\n<p>Find out before travelling how you will get enough Iranian rials for your visit legally. If you cannot, you may need to reconsider your travel plans.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surrogacy-and-adoption\">Surrogacy and adoption\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Iran to arrange an international surrogacy or adoption, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process\u00a0</li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Iranian and\u202fUK\u202flaws before making any arrangements\u00a0</li>\n  <li>read\u202f<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fand Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Iran to the\u202fUK, you must \u202f<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need an Iranian birth certificate for this. It\u2019s not possible for British nationals or dual nationals to apply for a UK passport in Iran.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Iran in 2024 is likely start on 10 March and last for 30 days until 8 April. During this time, do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. In public places women must cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor-length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic or coat that reaches to mid-thigh or knee. Men should wear long trousers and long-sleeved shirts in public.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are extra dress requirements at religious sites. Women may be asked to put on a chador (a garment that covers the whole body except the face) before entering.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-between-men-and-women\">Relationships between men and women\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Adultery and sex outside marriage are illegal under Iranian law and carry the death penalty.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Relationships between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal, although few Westerners have been prosecuted. If a Muslim woman is found in a relationship with a non-Muslim man, she may be sentenced to be whipped.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Unmarried partners and friends of the opposite sex travelling together should exercise extreme caution. Sex outside marriage and same-sex relations are against the law in Iran, with the death penalty as the defined punishment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Iranian hotel managers could insist on seeing a marriage certificate before allowing couples to share a hotel room.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-relationships\">LGBT+ relationships\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are illegal under Iranian law and can carry the death penalty.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-travellers\">Female travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Women should take extra care, particularly when travelling alone or with friends of the opposite sex. Women face a range of issues, from enforced hijab wearing to harassment due to there being relatively few foreign women in Iran. Respect local customs and avoid isolated areas. See more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"films-and-magazines\">Films and magazines\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Many western streaming services including Netflix and Prime are illegal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or drink alcohol in Iran. This is on religious grounds, with exceptions only for certain recognised Iranian religious minorities. Drinking alcohol in public is not allowed, with no exceptions. Penalties can be severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited. You can be detained and charged with breaking national security laws. Sensitive government buildings and facilities are often difficult to identify. Take extreme care when taking photographs in any area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted, especially if it contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on serious criminal charges, including espionage. It\u2019s better to ask before taking photographs of people.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs\">Illegal drugs\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or consume drugs in Iran. Penalties for importing and possessing drugs are severe and enforced. Many people convicted of drug offences, including foreign nationals, have been executed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You must carry copies of your passport photo page and visa for identification. Make sure you have a copy of the emergency contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"satellite-phones-and-drones\">Satellite phones and drones\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need permission from the Iranian authorities to import or use equipment like drones or satellite phones. Using them without permission is illegal and you could be arrested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones-internet-access-and-communications\">Mobile phones, internet access and communications\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have blocked, significantly slowed or shut down landline, internet and mobile services without warning in the past. This can be nationwide or localised. This can affect communication and location services on smartphones and other devices. You should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not rely on mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps or international calls for personal safety\u00a0</li>\n  <li>always keep an alternative means of communication and navigation with you</li>\n  <li>make sure friends and family know where you are\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-travellers\">Business travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Individuals involved in commercial disputes with Iranian companies risk being stopped from leaving the country until disputes are resolved.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Representatives of British or western companies may receive particular attention. British businesspeople travelling to Iran should take steps to protect commercially sensitive information, including password protection of electronic devices and not carrying unnecessary information. Electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u202fwhen using a UK driving licence\u202fto drive in Iran.

Take great care when travelling by car or public transport and when crossing streets. If you\u2019re involved in an accident, no matter how minor, do not leave the scene. Wait until the police arrive to write their report.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities sometimes set up informal roadblocks both in cities and on main highways. These are often staffed by young and inexperienced officers. Always carry identification with you and avoid getting into disputes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It is not widely accepted for women to drive motorbikes on public roads and there is a risk of being arrested.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Motorcycle taxis should not be used as they have sometimes taken tourists to quiet locations and robbed them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Pre-booked taxis are safer than taxis hailed from the street.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Iran that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u202fDepartment for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are very politically and militarily sensitive, with increased military activity including seizures and attempted seizures, boardings and harassment of maritime vessels.</p>\n\n<p>The waters around the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Persian Gulf are particularly sensitive. British national mariners should not dock or sail into waters around these islands.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When in the region, maintain a high state of awareness and be alert to local and regional tensions which may affect your route.

Vessels have also been seized in and around the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz in recent years resulting in detention of the vessels and crew.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If your vessel is hailed, provide the vessel name, flag state, and confirm they are exercising navigation rights and proceeding in accordance with international law, as reflected in the UNCLOS Convention. Vessels and mariners should maintain high levels of awareness when they are operating in the area and report into UKMTO. They should document footage of all incidents wherever possible.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Many parts of Iran are at risk of earthquakes and tremors.

There is an increased security presence on the ground and some roads around the city, in Rushan and other parts of GBAO have been temporarily closed to traffic. Especially in the light of instability in Afghanistan, the security situation is liable to change at short notice, with the possibility of further unrest.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in the region, you should remain vigilant in public places and be alert to any security announcements by the Tajik authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Several areas of the GBAO and other parts of the country are damaged by flooding in the spring and winter seasons and roads are often closed. Most of the infrastructure has been repaired, but many roads, including the Pamir Highway, are currently open but not fully repaired.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tavildara-region\">Tavildara region</h3>\n\n<p>Take local advice in the Tavildara region of central Tajikistan as there are a few minefields dating from the civil war in the mountains. Medical and rescue facilities are unreliable where they exist at all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Tajikistan. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Roads outside the main towns are poorly-maintained and often only accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles. Conditions are particularly treacherous in spring due to the risk of avalanches and landslides. Many interior roads are only open in the summer months. It is possible to drive from Dushanbe to the north and Tajikistan\u2019s second city, Khujand, via a tunnel, but this road is particularly dangerous in winter due to icy conditions and drivers can be trapped for a long time if caught in an avalanche because of the remoteness. The roads to GBAO are often closed in the winter.  Check local road conditions prior to travel.</p>\n\n<p>Local vehicles are poorly-maintained and driving standards are basic. Petrol stations are rare outside towns and there are no breakdown companies. Make sure you take all you need for your journey, allowing for delays. Emergency communications such as satellite phones are advisable for travel outside towns. Neighbouring countries may close borders temporarily.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>Flights in Tajikistan may be cancelled at short notice or substantially delayed. Overloading on local flights is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Instances of harassment by officials at Dushanbe International Airport have been reported to the British Embassy. This typically involves requests for payment for allegedly incorrect documentation or other offences. Some reports state that airport officials have acted in an intimidating manner. You should ensure, through your hotel or directly with the Tajikistan Office of Visas and Registration (OVIR) that your documentation and papers are in order before passing through border control at the airport. If you suffer harassment or intimidation at the airport you should report this to your travel agent and/or the consular bureau at the airport.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>You are advised to check the UK Air Safety List when flying with foreign air carriers. \u00a0The Civil Aviation Authority <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Air Safety List (ASL)</a> identifies foreign airlines which do not meet international safety standards. These airlines are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use the list to inform your decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas.</li>\n  <li>consult local travel providers to find alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Tajikistan.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Tajikistan can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EY\">Aviation Safety network.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Tajikistan\u2019s civil war ended in 1997.

In light of this incident, you should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Tajik/Uzbek border.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 July 2018, 7 tourists from western countries were cycling near Dangara in southern Tajikistan when a local man drove into them. This was a deliberate attack. Four of the 7 cyclists were killed by the vehicle\u2019s impact and wounds sustained in a subsequent knife attack carried out by the occupants of the car. This is the first incident of its kind in Tajikistan.  While the motives are not clear, the terrorist group Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed responsibility.  In light of this incident, you should exercise extreme caution and vigilance, particularly if hiking or cycling in the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a threat of kidnapping in Tajikistan. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers.

This may include attempts to disrupt traffic, disturbances in villages and near economic centres. These occasionally result in localised clashes between government security forces and protesters. Anniversaries of significant events in Bahrain sometimes carry an increased risk of protests, which can start with little warning. Locations where such incidents have taken place in the past include Sitra, Bani Jamra, Karbabad, Saar, Karzakan, the Budaiya Highway and surrounding villages.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant, follow the advice of the local authorities and be aware of your surroundings wherever you are on the island.</p>\n\n<p>Violent protests pose a risk to those who might inadvertently find themselves near to an active demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter a large public gathering or demonstration, leave the area immediately. If you see any suspect item, don\u2019t approach or touch it. Move away and call the police on 999 or the Police Hotline 8000 8008.</p>\n\n<p>Travel on the main routes during daylight hours is generally orderly. There are some police checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>During demonstrations, roads can become blocked, resulting in diversions. These may re-route you to areas with which you are unfamiliar. You should familiarise yourself with alternative routes.</p>\n\n<p>Developments in the wider region continue to have an impact on local public opinion. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which may trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Interior has issued a reminder that all residents and visitors must carry photographic ID. Under Bahraini law, it\u2019s an offence not to be able to present photographic ID if asked to do so by a member of the Bahraini authorities, and you may be subject to a fine of up to 300BHD.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Around 4,000 British nationals live in Bahrain, and thousands more visit each year. Most visits are trouble free. Crime is generally uncommon in most areas, but nevertheless visitors should take due care and attention, including using reputable taxi companies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Bahrain with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer, you will need to get either a local licence or an International Driving Permit (IDP). If you are using an IDP, please ensure that you visit the Traffic Authority upon arrival to have it certified.</p>\n\n<p>As of 28 March 2019, the IDP you will need in Bahrain is a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Bahrain after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Bahrain operates a zero tolerance policy to drink-driving. If you are caught you will be arrested and put in the drivers\u2019 prison. Your case will not be heard until the next working day. First time offenders will have to pay a minimum \u00a3900 fine and could be banned from driving in Bahrain. Visitors from Saudi Arabia will be subject to the same punishment but with the addition of a driving ban there also. For repeat offenders the fine and ban will be more serious.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Bahrain International Airport is modern and efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Although alcohol is available at Bahrain airport, security officers and airline staff deal firmly with passengers believed to be drunk - even those who are in transit through the airport. In such circumstance you may be denied boarding, detained and fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There is a Government of Bahrain imposed curfew on the waterways around Bahrain between 6.30pm and 4am. You should respect the curfew.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Many sea areas of the Gulf are considered highly sensitive by local authorities. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n",

Consuming or carrying illegal drugs, even if you are transiting through the airport from one country to another, can result in imprisonment and deportation. Buying or selling illegal drugs and narcotics is considered a serious crime which can result in life imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Bahrain such as CBD oil.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using prescribed drugs, it is advisable to carry a doctor\u2019s note. If you are bringing prescription drugs into Bahrain you may need to seek prior agreement from the authorities. You should check with the nearest Bahrain Embassy or consulate before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>Alcohol is legal in Bahrain with a number of bars, licensed restaurants and off-licences; however, drunken behaviour in public or driving under the influence of alcohol is against the law, making the offender liable to a fine or imprisonment and/or deportation and withdrawal of their driving licence. Physical assault and damaging public property whilst under the influence of alcohol is an offence, which may lead to a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones-and-uavs\">Drones and UAVs</h3>\n\n<p>Flying drones or remote-controlled Unmanned Air Vehicle flying devices either without a valid licence or in restricted airspace is against the law.

You can be charged and imprisoned if you are caught with even the smallest amount of alcohol in your system. Tailgating, speeding, racing, lane jumping and using a mobile phone while driving are all against the law and can result in heavy fines. There are numerous speed cameras on the roads and motorways. Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory. Failure to do so can result in a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code-in-bahrain\">Dress code in Bahrain</h3>\n\n<p>Dress conservatively in public places, especially religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Bahrainis often dress conservatively in traditional dress and can be offended when people dress inappropriately or not in accordance with Islamic values.</p>\n\n<p>In public places such as shopping malls, restaurants and parks, you are encouraged to dress appropriately. Clothing should not be transparent, indecently expose parts of the body or display offensive pictures or slogans. Be aware that if you enter one of these areas dressed inappropriately you may be asked to leave (most of the larger shopping malls display signs warning that respectable clothing should be worn). Any form of nudity is strictly forbidden, including topless sunbathing. These rules are even more closely observed during Ramadan when modesty is promoted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"respect-for-religion-in-bahrain\">Respect for religion in Bahrain</h3>\n\n<p>Islamic religious values are greatly respected in Bahrain. Showing any disrespect towards religious beliefs or practices is considered deeply offensive and very likely to result in a heavy fine and/or imprisonment. Other religions are respected in Bahrain and can be followed with freedom.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Muslims pray five times a day. You will notice that the mosques call people to pray through a speaker system\n*Be aware that drivers who are not close to a mosque, may stop at a convenient lay-by to pray privately</li>\n  <li>During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Throughout this month, eating, drinking, smoking, playing loud music and dancing in public places during daylight hours are strictly forbidden and punishable by law, including for non-Muslims.</li>\n</ul>\n",

If you\u2019re unsure how Bahrain\u2019s entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visas\">Visas</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bahrainembassy.co.uk/\">Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain</a>\u00a0before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The Government of Bahrain reintroduced visas on-arrival across the Kingdom\u2019s entry points from 4 September 2020. Travellers can also get a visa in advance, either <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.evisa.gov.bh/\">online</a>\u00a0or from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bahrainembassy.co.uk/\">Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain</a>\u00a0in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Holders of valid visas can enter Bahrain without the need for a letter of prior permission. This excludes visas issued on arrival at Bahrain\u2019s ports and airports. Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.</p>\n\n<p>In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the Nationality, Passports and Residential Affairs department at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA).  Individuals should enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.npra.gov.bh/en-inquiries-and-proposals/\">NPRA website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/20/bahrain#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exit-requirements\">Exit requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-bans\">Travel bans</h3>\n\n<p>You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute.</p>\n\n<p>Travel bans are legal prohibitions the Government of Bahrain imposes to prevent persons involved in disputes from departing the country. They can be the result of a civil or criminal dispute or immigration violation. They are not lifted until the matter, i.e. civil suit; criminal case or immigration violation is settled. Persons who are involved in disputes or investigations can check if travel bans apply with the Bahrain Immigration Department. Often travellers do not learn that they are subject to a travel ban until they attempt to depart the country or on entry into the country.</p>\n\n",

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>The Dominican Republic is friendly and welcoming and the vast majority of visits to the country are trouble-free. However, there is a high crime rate, ranging from opportunistic crime like bag snatching and pickpocketing to violent crime.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime, including pickpocketing and robbery takes place across the country. Don\u2019t wear expensive jewellery or carry large amounts of cash or valuable items like smart phones or cameras on the street. Keep electronic devices out of sight and use a hotel safe whenever possible. Don\u2019t leave your bags or other possessions on chairs or tables in restaurants or bars.</p>\n\n<p>Drive-by robberies can occur, where thieves on motorcycles snatch bags and valuables from pedestrians and sometimes reach through the windows of cars at red lights to steal belongings. Victims are sometimes hurt in the process. Keep valuables out of sight, and if you have a bag with you, carry it on the side away from the street. If travelling in a car, drive with doors locked and windows closed.</p>\n\n<p>Violent crime and armed robberies against foreigners do sometimes take place, particularly in large cities. There have been a number of incidents in Santo Domingo where foreigners have been mugged at gunpoint or knifepoint during the daytime while walking in residential districts.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care at night and in remote areas. If you\u2019re robbed, don\u2019t resist, as this increases the risk of being hurt. Be aware that your attacker may be armed, even if you cannot see a weapon. Don\u2019t use unregistered taxis, or hail a taxi on the street: use an authorised airport or hotel taxi service, or book a taxi from a reliable provider.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreigners have occurred, including at beach resorts. In some cases, hotel employees or fellow guests have been implicated. Be cautious when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances, be wary of rides or other invitations, avoid walking alone at night and don\u2019t leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you should report it immediately to the British Embassy. Consular staff can help you to report the incident with local authorities if you wish to do so, explaining the process and assisting with the language barrier if required. No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint to Dominican authorities before departing the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you lose your passport or it is stolen, a police report should be obtained before contacting the British Embassy. The English speaking tourist police (POLITUR) can be contacted on +1-809-200-3500.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-safety-and-sports\">Water safety and sports</h2>\n\n<p>Lifeguards may not be present at swimming pools or on beaches and safety and rescue equipment may not be available.</p>\n\n<p>The sea can be dangerous, especially during the hurricane season (June-November). Seek local advice about sea conditions and warning systems and follow instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go into the water if you\u2019re under the influence of alcohol or other substances.</p>\n\n<p>Providers of recreational and adventure tourism may not meet UK safety standards.\nCheck safety standards and make sure you\u2019re insured if you take part in activities like water sports, quad biking, horse riding etc. If in doubt seek advice from your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is closed, this is liable to change at short notice and you should monitor local media for updates. The UK currently advises against all travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation.</p>\n\n<p>Military and police road blocks are common, especially in the areas near the Haitian border. The road blocks can appear to be unofficial, although the soldiers do wear army uniform and carry weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care on roads close to the Haitian border. There have been armed robberies in the Dominican Republic on roads close to the border with Haiti, including by criminals dressed as police officers.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are cheap but many are in a state of disrepair. There have been cases of theft from taxis, so keep valuables and cash secure and out of sight. Tourist taxis are safer and more reliable, but also more expensive. Ride-hailing apps, such as Uber, are available and widely used.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use motorbike taxis (\u201cmotoconchos\u201d) or motorbike ride-hailing apps: the quality of driving is poor and passengers are often not provided with a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>A range of transport is available, including the newly-expanded metro system in Santo Domingo. Avoid public buses and \u201ccarros publicos\u201d (shared cars which run on certain routes, picking up passengers) for safety and security reasons. However, private companies do operate good bus services between cities.</p>\n\n<p>Pedestrians should take extra care when crossing roads. Drivers will not always signal when they intend to turn and motorbikes in particular will sometimes disregard red traffic lights.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to hire a car in the Dominican Republic, with many international car hire companies available in major cities and at airports.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for visits not exceeding 3 months. For longer visits, you should apply for a local driving licence, for which you will need to present a certified copy of your valid UK licence.</p>\n\n<p>To certify your driving licence, you will need to get a copy certified by a UK notary or lawyer in the UK. Once this is done, the Legalisation Office in the UK needs to attach an apostille and return the legalised driving licence to you. While some notaries may not be willing to carry out a notarial act without an individual being present, others are, and are also willing to forward applications to the Legalisation Office once they have completed their part. You can find a list of notaries currently authorised to practice on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/notary/find-a-notary\">website of the Faculty Office</a> (the regulator of Notaries Public in England and Wales). You should contact notaries directly to check whether you would need to be present when they notarise your driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>The Dominican Republic has one of the highest death rates in the world for road traffic accidents. Road accidents are frequent, especially during holiday periods like Christmas and Easter. Drivers often do not respect traffic laws, weave from lane to lane and rarely signal. Many vehicles are in a state of disrepair and don\u2019t have working headlights or mirrors. Drink driving is common. The quality of roads vary, although the motorways connecting cities and tourist areas are good.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible you should avoid driving outside the main cities at night, as there may be poor lighting, animals or pedestrians on the road and other cars driving without headlights. If police stop you for a traffic violation, you are entitled to request a traffic ticket and to ask to see the officer\u2019s identification.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care if travelling on motorbikes or scooters. According to the WHO, 63% of the road deaths in the Dominican Republic were people on motorcycles or scooters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-accidents\">Road accidents</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, you must file a report with the authorities. If the accident didn\u2019t cause injuries and happened in Santo Domingo or Santiago, you should register it at\u00a0an accident reporting centre such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://casadelconductor.com.do/\">La Casa del Conductor</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.centrodelautomovilista.com/\">El Centro del Automovilista</a>. You should consult your insurance company for guidance on which centre you should use to report an accident. These are government dependencies with English speaking agents, where there are representatives from all the relevant authorities including the police and insurance companies. If the accident occurs in any other part of the Dominican Republic, you should file a report at the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident that causes serious injury or death, Dominican law requires that the driver is taken into police custody until the circumstances of the accident have been investigated, even if the driver appears not to be at fault. You should call the police, and wait for them to arrive, at the scene of the accident.  If you\u2019re detained as a result of a road accident, ask the police to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-santo-domingo\">British Embassy in Santo Domingo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The telephone number for national roadside assistance is +1-829-689-1000.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Political demonstrations sometimes occur, although not usually near tourist areas. Avoid getting caught up in demonstrations or large gatherings of people and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n",

All sentences are served in the Dominican Republic.</p>\n\n<p>Seizures at ports and airports around the Dominican Republic have increased. Pack your own luggage and do not carry anything through customs for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Local attitudes towards the LGBT community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. Although same-sex sexual relations are legal in the Dominican Republic, same-sex marriages are not legally recognised. Public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention.

All luggage is scanned as you enter the country. DVDs and videos may be examined, censored and confiscated.</p>\n\n<p>Qatar law also prohibits the importation, sale and purchase of electronic cigarettes, liquids and other similar products (e.g. electronic shisha pipes).

You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists issue statements threatening to carry out attacks in the Gulf region. These include references to attacks on western interests, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>residential compounds</li>\n  <li>military sites</li>\n  <li>oil</li>\n  <li>transport and aviation interests</li>\n  <li>restaurants</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>beaches</li>\n  <li>shopping centres</li>\n  <li>mosques</li>\n  <li>large demonstrations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Events in the region, including political developments, have an impact on local public opinion. Be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow news reports and avoid public gatherings and demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays.</p>\n\n<p>If any incidents occur, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime levels are low, but take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, particularly at night, and should use reputable taxi companies.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. Sentences can be severe. However, Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual.  If they are determined to have been consensual, the victim or attacker may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been sexually assaulted, contact the British Embassy for advice (00 974 4496 2000). You can also read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-information-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault/guidance-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-in-qatar\">guidance for victims of rape or sexual assault in Qatar</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Qatar is an Islamic country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not cause offence, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. There may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK but is in Qatar.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You are required by law to carry a physical form of identification at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Dress modestly in public, including while driving:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>women should cover their shoulders and not wear short skirts</li>\n  <li>men and women should not wear shorts or sleeveless tops in government buildings, healthcare facilities or malls - if you do, you may be asked to leave or be denied entry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Qatar in 2024 will  likely start on 10 March and will last for 30 days. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes  \u2013 clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Only licensed hotels, restaurants and bars can sell alcohol. Expatriates living in Qatar can get alcohol on a permit system. Don\u2019t carry alcohol around with you (except to take it on the day of collection from the warehouse to your home). The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. Places serving alcohol will ask for original photo IDs (copies are not accepted) upon entry.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. For example, if you drink in a non-licenced public place, you could get a prison sentence of up to 6 months or a fine up to 3,000 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-outside-marriage\">Relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Any intimacy in public, between any couples (including between teenagers), can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Living together while unmarried is illegal in Qatar. Sex outside marriage is illegal for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. You can be arrested and punishments can include a fine, a custodial sentence and deportation once the sentence is complete.</p>\n\n<p>Because of laws on sex outside marriage, if someone becomes pregnant outside marriage, both partners could face imprisonment or deportation. Doctors will ask for proof of marriage during antenatal checks.</p>\n\n<p>An unmarried woman who gives birth in Qatar may also face problems registering the birth of the child in Qatar, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the Qatari authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate. Authorities may compare the marriage date against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Qatar. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Organisers of protests need to get permission from the Ministry of Interior. This must be done in advance and cannot be spontaneous.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swearing-and-rude-gestures\">Swearing and rude gestures</h3>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts. You can be jailed or deported. Take particular care when dealing with police and other officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is prohibited in all closed public spaces including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, public transport, malls, restaurants and government buildings.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to vape/use an e-cigarette or import vapes into the country. You can be arrested and punishments can include a fine, a custodial sentence or deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences in Qatar, including some medications which are legal in other countries, but illegal in Qatar. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/qatar/health#bringing-medication-into-qatar\">bringing medication into Qatar</a></p>\n\n<p>Penalties for using, trafficking, smuggling and possessing drugs (even residual amounts) are severe. Punishment can include lengthy custodial sentences, heavy fines and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when filming or photographing people as taking pictures of people without their consent can cause offense.</p>\n\n<p>Some visitors attempting to film or photograph near religious, military, government or construction sites have been arrested. If in doubt, seek permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalistic-activity\">Journalistic activity</h3>\n\n<p>Journalists must get permission from the Qatar News Agency (QNA) to film or photograph as part of their work and enter the country on a visiting press permit. This permit allows you to take technical equipment like cameras through airport customs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"social-media\">Social media</h3>\n\n<p>There are strict privacy laws in Qatar. Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that appear to insult, slander or are culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime. Individuals have been detained, prosecuted and convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crimes\">Financial crimes</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fraud</li>\n  <li>giving somebody a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and \u2018security\u2019 cheques)</li>\n  <li>non-payment of bills (for example hotel bills or car hire)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also be liable for cheques that you have signed on behalf of a company.</p>\n\n<p>Financial crimes can be punished with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>imprisonment</li>\n  <li>fines</li>\n  <li>deportation</li>\n  <li>freezing bank accounts and other assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have unpaid loans or financial commitments you won\u2019t be able to cancel your residence permit, and may be prevented from leaving Qatar, including to go on holiday. All debts should be settled in full before you leave the country. Ask your bank for a certificate to confirm you have no outstanding debt once you have cleared the balance.</p>\n\n<p>If you have sponsorship, it may be blocked, which will prevent you from transferring to a new sponsor (employer). Any end of service benefits you may be entitled to could be used to offset the outstanding debt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deportation\">Deportation</h3>\n\n<p>If you are found guilty of an offence, you may be deported. This can happen whether or not the judgement included deportation. This may affect your ability to return to Qatar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Get a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> if you plan to drive on your UK licence. You can get IDPs over the counter from many UK post offices. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Qatar with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months with a valid IDP.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-in-qatar\">Driving in Qatar</h3>\n\n<p>The driver and front seat passenger must wear a seat belt at all times. It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving, and you could be fined 500 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<p>Flashing your lights in Qatar can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a custodial sentence of between one month and 3 years, a fine of 10,000 to 50,000 Qatari riyals, or both. Offenders may also be deported.</p>\n\n<p>Even minor expressions of \u2018road rage\u2019 like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. You may be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fined</li>\n  <li>imprisoned</li>\n  <li>deported</li>\n  <li>banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved \u2013 serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://portal.moi.gov.qa/metrash2/en/index.html\">Metrash2 app</a> before trying to leave the country, which lists any outstanding traffic violations. If you have an outstanding violation, you could be detained at immigration and denied onward travel. Fines for all violations should be settled in full before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n\n<p>Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and accidents are common. If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle until the police arrive and tell you that you can leave. It\u2019s illegal to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it\u2019s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You\u2019ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly-equipped 4x4 vehicle. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in convoy with other cars</li>\n  <li>take a supply of water and a mobile telephone</li>\n  <li>leave travel plans with friends or relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"transport-safety\">Transport safety</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport. If using apps, check licence plates and confirm with drivers the passenger name. Let someone know you are on the way home and the registration details of the car.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can not offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Crime tends to occur within local communities but can sometimes affect visitors.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain a high level of security awareness. The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. Don\u2019t walk alone in deserted areas, even in daylight, and try to avoid travel beyond major populated areas late at night and before dawn. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and over the counter in banks and financial institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Theft from vehicles and property occurs in parts of downtown Port of Spain and other towns/cities. Make sure your accommodation is secure and use a hotel safe to store valuables, money and passports. Take particular care when driving, especially at night, and take local advice to avoid straying into areas affected by gang violence. Always drive with windows closed and doors locked. Crimes including rape and murder, kidnapping for ransom, assault, robbery and theft have taken place in private cars and maxi taxis. You should exercise caution when using informal and maxi taxis.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of violence and fatal accidents caused by drunk driving including  on the Beetham/Churchill Roosevelt Highway to and from the airport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tobago\">Tobago</h3>\n<p>Most visits to Tobago are trouble free and incidents of violent crime are rare. However, there have been recent incidents involving tourists (including British nationals) being robbed and raped.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain at least the same level of security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your living accommodation is secure. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Use a hotel safe to store valuables, money and passports. Petty theft from cars is common.</p>\n\n<p>Villas, particularly those in isolated areas, should have adequate security, including external security lighting, grills and overnight security guards.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t walk alone in deserted areas including beaches even in daylight. Consult your tour operator if in doubt. Don\u2019t take lifts with unknown persons (unless with proper known/ licensed taxis)</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant at all times and carry a mobile phone with roaming capability for use in emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carnival-and-other-large-scale-celebrations\">Carnival and other large-scale celebrations</h3>\n\n<p>If you are attending a large-scale event, such as the Carnival celebrations in Trinidad or Tobago, you should take sensible precautions and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times. There are likely to be higher levels of thefts and opportunistic crime during the carnival period, which includes the parties and fetes throughout the country. This is in addition to increased police patrols and roadblocks. Avoid displaying jewellery or items that may attract criminals. Do not leave your drinks unattended, practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive in Trinidad and Tobago with a valid UK driving licence for up to 90 days.  If you\u2019re staying longer/living in Trinidad and Tobago, you will need to get a local Driver\u2019s Permit from the Trinidad and Tobago Licensing Division.  You can check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-trinidad-tobago#driving-licenses-and-vehicles\">Living in Trinidad and Tobago guide</a> for information on licence requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving and observe speed limits. Some roads are narrow and winding, and the surface is of a low standard. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving in Trinidad and Tobago is mixed. High speed road accidents on the main highways in Trinidad often result in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>Use hotel or pre-booked taxis and drivers who work with set fares. Private taxis in Trinidad and Tobago are unmetered and unmarked but can be identified by vehicle registration plates beginning with \u2018H\u2019. They can take the form of either a private car or \u2018maxi taxi\u2019 minibus. Some vehicles with \u2018P\u2019 registration plates offer informal taxi services illegally.</p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a vehicle, use hotel taxis to get around, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.</p>\n",

You can also queue up to get a tourist visa on arrival, but payment must be made in cash, with US dollars being the preferred currency. Applying in advance can reduce the time it takes you to pass through immigration. Visas are available for several lengths of stay at various costs. Look on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.immigration.gov.np/\">immigration department website for the options and how to apply</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Overstaying your visa in Nepal is a serious crime, and can lead to significant fines or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/159/nepal\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Nepal guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are arriving in Nepal directly from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, you will need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Nepal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Nepal. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing precious metals into Nepal is strictly regulated. You can carry gold ornaments up to 50 grams and silver ornaments up to 100 grams.

Customs will give a certified declaration which you must keep. You will need to convert all your Nepali currency before you leave Nepal, and the bank or exchange counter at the airport may ask you for the declaration.</p>\n\n<p>ATMs are not reliable outside main tourist sites.</p>\n\n",

If you are caught with even small amounts of marijuana, you can go to prison for over 5 years, usually after a long and expensive legal process. Police are arresting an increasing number of people for smuggling drugs into and out of Nepal.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and e-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Nepal such as Cannabidiol (CBD). If the police find you with products containing CBD, they may seize them and charge you with drug possession.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Nepal is generally open and tolerant to LGBT+ issues, and same-sex relations are not illegal. However, any show of affection in public, irrespective of sexuality or gender, is viewed by Nepalis as inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Nepal is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which bans trade of wildlife products without a permit.

You can ask for a copy by sending an email to: <a href=\"mailto:info@swc.org.np\">info@swc.org.np</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy has received reports of volunteer opportunities at orphanages which are profit-orientated organisations rather than charities. If you\u2019re volunteering at this type of organisation, you could be contributing to child exploitation. Contact the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board on +977 1-5010045 and 5010046 to check before signing up to volunteer for one of these organisations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> and your UK driving licence to drive in Nepal. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Always carry your IDP with you when driving, as well as your vehicle registration documents.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Nepal, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldriversassociation.com/nepal-driving-guide\">International Drivers Association Nepal driving guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Road accidents are a major cause of death and disability in Nepal. The causes range from overloading vehicles, negligence of drivers, mechanical failure, speeding, poor road conditions and an increasing number of unregulated private vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor, especially during the monsoon season or in mountain areas. The 2015 earthquakes affected many roads and reconstruction work is still ongoing, making conditions worse.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the law to wear a helmet when driving a motorbike.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bus-travel\">Bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Bus accidents are common in Nepal and there are a number of accidents resulting in fatalities every year. Buses are often overcrowded, poorly regulated, and poorly maintained. Speeding, low driving standards and poor road conditions contribute to the risk of accidents. Do not travel on overloaded or overcrowded buses, or at night. Tourist buses usually offer a higher standard of comfort and safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Air crashes can have a variety of causes and are not necessarily linked with poor safety standards or non-compliance with international safety standards. However, there have been a number of fatal accidents and air crashes across Nepal in the commercial air transport sector (involving planes and helicopters). Over the last 5 years, this includes a number of separate incidents and at least 100 deaths.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>)</a> lists all known airlines in Nepal that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering whether to fly and which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Currently no Nepali airline meets the international safety standards and so all are listed on the <abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>. This means they are all banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Travel during the monsoon season (June to September) can be hazardous. Flooding and landslides cut off towns and villages for days at a time. If you travel by road during monsoon season you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check the road is open</li>\n  <li>be prepared to change or cancel your plans at short notice</li>\n  <li>make sure any vehicle you travel in is equipped with a winch and ropes in case of landslides</li>\n  <li>take enough supplies to cover any possible delays</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The government of Nepal <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mfd.gov.np/\">Meteorological Forecasting Division</a> provides weather updates (in English) and flood forecasts during the monsoon. You can also access the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.dhm.gov.np/hydrology/floodMonitoring\">Department of Hydrology and Meteorology flood monitoring service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Major earthquakes in 2015 caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure particularly in northern parts of Gorkha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchok and Dolakha districts. These include the Manaslu and Langtang national parks.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the country is fully open for tourism, including most trekking routes, though reconstruction continues in some areas of the country. Check with your tour company before trekking.</p>\n\n<p>Earth tremors are common across Nepal. The impact of an earthquake is likely to be worsened by the lack of emergency equipment and poorly resourced medical facilities. British Embassy assistance will be slow to reach you if you are in a remote area.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your tour operator to find out what contingency plans they have for an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0National Society of Earthquake Technology - Nepal (NSET) gives <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nset.org.np/\">advice on what to do in an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n",

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, repatriation and evacuation by helicopter.

As part of the ceasefire agreement a Russian peacekeeping operation has been deployed to the area to monitor Armenian populated areas of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Lachin Corridor.  On 13 September 2022, there was military action, in several areas, across the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

These areas include, but are not limited to, the towns and rayons of Barda, Tartar, Ganja, Beylagan and Aghjabadi. The Azerbaijani authorities are working to remove UXO. However if you come across UXO do not approach it, or touch it. Make a note of where it was spotted, and notify the authorities on 102 or 112.

You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re temporarily or permanently resident in Azerbaijan, after one month of your residence permit being issued you will only be able to drive with an Azerbaijan-issued driving licence. Driving licences are issued through <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://asan.gov.az/en\">ASAN Service Offices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad.

Accidents are common, mainly due to poor or reckless driving and inconsistent enforcement of traffic rules. One-way only signs are often ignored and road closures and diversions are not marked. Traffic lights are often switched to flashing amber at night, which means both directions can proceed with caution.</p>\n\n<p>There are a variety of taxi options available in Baku including private hire, app-based, and London-style metered cabs. Some visitors have reported being severely over-charged by local taxis. When using taxis you should agree a fare up front, or make sure the taxi meter is switched on. You should also check that the taxi has working seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving particularly at night. Many roads are of poor quality and badly lit.</p>\n\n<p>Drink driving laws are strict and there is a zero limit on drinking alcohol and driving. Observe the speed limit and make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in a vehicle that is travelling at an unsafe speed you should instruct the driver to slow down.</p>\n\n<p>In the winter months snowfall often causes problems. Keep a blanket, shovel, torch, snacks and old carpet (to help if you get stuck in snow) if you intend to travel out of Baku in the winter months, or if heavy snowfall is forecast in Baku.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/azerbaijan/\">RAC</a> guide on driving in Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The Baku Metro is reasonably maintained and has basic safety equipment and procedures.

These could escalate without warning.  Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks and be alert to local and regional developments, which may trigger public disturbances.

Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don\u2019t offend other cultures or religious beliefs, including the photographing or videoing of mosques, churches and other religious sites or sites of commemoration, such as Martyr\u2019s Alley in Baku.  If in doubt, seek permission.</p>\n\n<p>When visiting religious areas, or during the holy month of Ramadan, pay extra attention to ensure your actions are culturally sensitive.  For further information, you should read our guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travelling-during-ramadan\">travelling during Ramadan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Baku local and foreign women usually dress in western-style clothing. It is now more acceptable for men in Baku to wear shorts in the summer months but outside of Baku it can be frowned upon and attract unwelcome attention.</p>\n\n<p>Possession or use of illegal drugs of any kind carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. The usual penalty for smuggling drugs is a prison term of between 3 to 7 years and/or a heavy fine.</p>\n\n<p>Police sometimes carry out checks of identity documents. You should carry your passport at all times. Keep it secure and leave a photocopy of the details page separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>While homosexuality is not illegal, LGBT+ people in Azerbaijan tend to keep a low profile as it is not acceptable to a large part of society. This is particularly true outside Baku and among the older generation. Public displays of affection are frowned upon, especially outside of Baku. Physical contact between men (holding hands, embracing etc) is usually a sign of friendship. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You need an export certificate to take antiques or art like carpets, samovars, copperware or paintings out of Azerbaijan. These are available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://azcarpetmuseum.az/front/en\">Carpet Museum</a> or through the seller. You should catalogue and declare to Customs any carpets or anything antique looking \u2013 even if clearly from a different part of the world - that you bring to Azerbaijan with you. Your relocation company should be able to offer you advice on this.</p>\n\n<p>Military bases, equipment and installations in whatever condition are considered sensitive areas, and visitors have been detained and questioned while attempting to visit or photograph them.

You should be aware of this, take sensible precautions in your daily movements and avoid confrontation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Pick pocketing, bag snatching and low level street crime are common in Dakar, particularly around Place de l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendence, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche as well as Gor\u00e9e Island. This type of crime is more common in the run-up to religious festivals. They can also increase early in the month after salaries are paid. Recent examples of street crime have also included attackers grabbing bags, phones or necklaces whilst driving scooters or motorbikes. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions: e.g. avoid walking alone in the evening and after dark, be alert if using a mobile phone in public and hold it on the side facing away from the road and avoid carrying valuables and bags in public.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re expecting someone to collect you at the airport, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off.

Scams come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose a great financial risk to victims. You should be cautious about requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. This includes requests from people who claim to be victims of various Western African conflicts (notably refugees from Sierra Leone) or relatives of present or former political leaders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-demonstrations\">Political demonstrations</h3>\n\n<p>Demonstrations about political issues occur frequently and are likely to increase in the build up to presidential elections in February 2024.</p>\n\n<p>These demonstrations usually take place in Dakar and other cities.

Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. Senegalese Armed Forces conduct small operations near the border with The Gambia to combat wood trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/senegal/safety-and-security\">See Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Senegal with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Senegal, you\u2019ll need to get a Senegalese driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>While some main roads are of good quality, other roads can be poor especially during the rainy season from June to September. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are unpredictable. Some taxis and public mini-buses (\u2018car rapide\u2019) are not roadworthy by UK standards.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic congestion also increases throughout Senegal in the run up to and during religious festivals. You should take particular care and attention to avoid accidents. Driving after dark is more dangerous because of poor street and vehicle lighting. If you do have an accident you must contact the police (dial  17 from a local phone) and wait for them to arrive at the scene. Do not move the car involved in the accident until a police officer gives you permission to do so. In more remote areas you may need to go directly to the nearest police station in order to report the incident.</p>\n",

The Sahel region includes Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad but the threat may extend to other neighbouring countries, including Senegal, and the wider region due to the porous nature of the borders and the desire from these groups to demonstrate capability and influence across the wider region.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent with a general breakdown in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas and there have been deaths and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>Although protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), the authorities can set up roadblocks anywhere at short notice and these cause significant travel disruptions. Your travel plans may be affected at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities. If you take part in protests, you may be detained and deported. Avoid all demonstrations and protests and do not try to pass through blockades. Follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator or airline and monitor local and social media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are high levels of crime in Honduras. Most serious crime does not affect tourists, but there have been attacks on foreigners, including armed robbery and sexual assault. Attacks can take place anywhere at any time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Petty theft is a problem in cities and tourist areas, including the Bay Islands (Roat\u00e1n, Utila and Guanaja). Avoid walking around Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and other main towns and cities in mainland Honduras. Be particularly careful at bus stations, airports, isolated beaches, tourist sites and on public transport. Keep your valuables locked away in a safe if possible. Avoid displaying valuable items like jewellery, cameras, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atm-crime\">ATM crime</h3>\n\n<p>Criminals have robbed foreigners after they\u2019ve withdrawn money at ATMs.</p>\n\n<p>ATMs are available in the major towns. Check with your hotel which ATMs to use, especially in Roat\u00e1n. It is safer to withdraw money from ATMs in shopping centres and to change money in hotels or banks. Check ATMs for evidence of tampering, although affected machines may not be easy to spot. Do not withdraw a lot of money at one time and avoid withdrawals at night.</p>\n\n<p>People have been killed and injured resisting criminals. It is useful to carry a small amount of money to hand out if you\u2019re robbed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-attacks-against-vehicles\">Violent attacks against vehicles</h3>\n\n<p>There have been violent attacks on people in cars and buses. Using a reputable tour company for longer journeys may reduce the risks. For shorter distances, use radio-dispatched taxis or hotel taxis. It is generally safer to travel on main roads between major cities and tourist destinations.</p>\n\n<p>Take precautions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>locking vehicle doors</li>\n  <li>keeping windows closed</li>\n  <li>not travelling after dark</li>\n  <li>travelling in convoy</li>\n  <li>not picking up hitchhikers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take care if you\u2019re travelling alone. In remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or join a tour. Do not accept lifts from strangers or hitchhike.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). There has been an increase in armed attacks by local gangs on bus drivers and conductors, often resulting in serious injury or death. There have been violent muggings, rape and assault against foreigners on these buses. Private intercity coach services are safer but not immune from attack.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks on roads:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>from Limones to La Union</li>\n  <li>from Olancho via Salama to Saba</li>\n  <li>from Gualaco to San Esteban</li>\n  <li>from La Esperanza to Gracias</li>\n  <li>in the Department of Santa Barbara</li>\n  <li>in and around Tela, La Ceiba, Trujillo and El Progreso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they\u2019re asked to transfer funds to you in Honduras. Tell them to contact you to check that you\u2019ve made this request.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"state-of-exception-emergency\">State of exception (emergency)\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>As part of its plan to address extortion, the Honduras government announced a state of exception (emergency) in December 2022. This measure has been repeatedly extended and remains in place, affecting over 100 municipalities across the country.</p>\n\n<p>During this time there may be restrictions on freedom of movement and other rights in the affected municipalities. Seek advice from your travel agent. You must always carry a valid ID and be prepared for checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>allow extra time to reach your destination</li>\n  <li>monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds or demonstrations</li>\n  <li>always co-operate with military and police officers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id-and-travel-documents\">Personal ID and travel documents</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry photo ID. Carry a copy of the photo page of your passport with you. Leave the original in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you always have the documents for your hotel, car rental, tour or ticket reservations. Local authorities may stop you and ask for documents confirming your travel plans.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug trafficking (15 to 20 years in prison and a very large fine) and drug use (from 3 to 9 months in a rehabilitation centre). Honduran prisons are overcrowded and violent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal. There are no laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. There is no recognition of same-sex marriage. People in the capital, Tegucigalpa, are largely tolerant of individuals\u2019 personal lifestyles and accept small signs of affection between same-sex couples. There is a more conservative attitude outside the capital and showing affection in public is not recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>US dollars are widely accepted for exchange and payment. It is difficult to exchange British pounds in Honduras.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Honduras for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in an accident, contact the police or the fire brigade (telephone: 911), stay with your vehicle and wait for the police to arrive. If you\u2019re in a serious accident, you may be taken into custody regardless of responsibility. Seek legal help and inform the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-honduras\">British Embassy in Guatemala</a>.\u00a0 Take full details of the other driver (who may not be insured), and do not rely solely on the vehicle\u2019s number plate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards in Honduras are generally poor. Avoid road travel at night. Many vehicles travel without lights, and animals often wander across roads causing accidents. You may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle if you are not travelling on main roads.</p>\n\n<p>Public buses are often poorly maintained, overcrowded and recklessly driven. Accidents are common and sometimes fatal. Luxury buses, operated by private companies, are usually better maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Some roads remain damaged by hurricanes that struck in 2020.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Airlines in Honduras can change their schedules at short notice. Before you travel, check with your airline or travel agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Drought, forest fires and flash flooding are common in Honduras.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season in Honduras normally runs from June to November. Landslides and flooding can affect roads throughout the country. You should monitor local weather reports and check the warnings from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">US National Hurricane Center</a>. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See the Honduran national civil protection website\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://copeco.gob.hn/\">COPECO</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in Honduras.

If you are visiting Roat\u00e1n, travel with a reputable guide. If you are driving a car or scooter, avoid side roads in remote areas, particularly Palm Beach Road close to Milton Bight.</p>\n\n<p>Take care on beaches in Tela and the north coast towns after dark.

The vast majority of visits are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport including the \u2018Careem\u2019 and \u2018Uber\u2019 apps. In Dubai authorised taxis are painted cream with different coloured roofs \u2013 taxis with pink roofs have female drivers. In Abu Dhabi taxis are painted silver/grey.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. The UAE imposes life imprisonment for males who rape a female and the death penalty can be applied in certain cases.  However, UAE law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, either party may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside marriage in certain circumstances. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates/local-laws-and-customs\">Local Laws and customs</a> page</p>\n\n<p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, and should use a reputable taxi company, particularly at night.

If you intend to drive a private vehicle as a visitor, you should check that you\u2019re covered under the vehicle\u2019s insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re applying for residence in the UAE, you can use your UK licence until your residence permit is issued, after which you\u2019ll need to immediately get a UAE driving licence from the traffic department.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards in the UAE are not always as disciplined as in the UK and there is a high rate of traffic accidents. Speeding is common.</p>\n\n<p>It is a criminal offence in the UAE to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount. Your insurance is also likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident. Offensive gestures and bad language directed at other drivers can lead to fines, a jail sentence, and possibly deportation. Flashing your lights in the UAE can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident you should follow the rules of the Emirate in which you are travelling. In Abu Dhabi, if no one has been hurt and vehicle damage is minor, drivers should move vehicles to the side of the road to avoid blocking traffic; otherwise, the vehicles should not be moved. In Dubai, you should only move your vehicle if it is causing an obstruction to other motorists. In the other Emirates, you may only move your car if the accident is minor and both parties agree who is responsible. In all cases, call the police. It is an offence to leave the scene of an accident before the police have arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be dangerous unless you\u2019re in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave a copy of your travel plans with friends or relatives.</p>\n\n<p>Pedestrians should take great care. Only cross roads using designated pedestrian crossings, failure to comply can lead to prosecution. Vehicles often don\u2019t stop at zebra crossings marked on the roads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. Mariners should make careful enquiries before entering these waters.</p>\n\n<p>You should consider how regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful when travelling by tourist boat. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Events in the Middle East can affect local public opinion.

The penalties for trafficking, smuggling and the possession of drugs (including residual amounts) are severe. Sentences for drug trafficking can include the death penalty. Possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum three-month prison term or a fine of between AED 20,000 and AED100,000. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession. Some herbal highs, like Spice, are illegal in the UAE. Possessing and concealing money from drugs related offences, and performing transactions using money from drug-related offences are also crimes, which could lead to imprisonment and a fine.</p>\n\n<p>Many people stop off in UAE airports on their way to other destinations. UAE airports have excellent technology and security, so transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in the UAE such as CBD oil. If found in possession of such products, they will be confiscated and you may face criminal charges.

Liquor licences are still required for Residents in Dubai but are no longer required for Residents in Abu Dhabi and other Emirates (save for Emirate of Sharjah) to purchase alcohol for personal consumption.</p>\n\n<p>In Dubai, tourists are able to obtain a temporary liquor licence for the duration of a month from the two official liquor distributors in Dubai. Tourists will be provided with a code of conduct document and will be asked to confirm they understand rules and regulations in relation to purchasing, transporting and consuming liquor in Dubai. This licence is only for use in the Emirate where it is issued.</p>\n\n<p>Liquor licences are not available to non-residents in the other Emirates, but it is possible for tourists and visitors to buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. However, you should be aware that it is a punishable offence under UAE law to drink or be under the influence of alcohol in public. British nationals have been arrested and charged under this law, often in cases where they have come to the attention of the police for a related offence, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the legal age for drinking alcohol is 18 in Abu Dhabi, but a Ministry of Tourism by-law prevents hotels from serving alcohol to those under the age of 21. In Dubai and all other emirates besides Sharjah, the drinking age is 21. Drinking alcohol in Sharjah is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Women should dress modestly when in public areas like shopping malls.

Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.</p>\n\n<p>Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-relationships-outside-marriage\">Sexual relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>If you become pregnant and give birth to a child in the UAE outside marriage, to obtain a local birth certificate both you and your partner will need to ensure that you either get married or you and/or your partner must singly or jointly acknowledge the child and provide identification papers and travel documents in accordance with the laws of your country considering the applicable laws of that nation. If you become pregnant outside of marriage, you may not be covered by your medical insurance, and you should consult with your medical insurance provider before giving birth in the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Consensual sexual relationships between a male and female outside marriage where both are over the age of 18 years, including extra-marital sexual relationships, is generally permitted under UAE law.  However, in the case of an extra-marital consensual sexual relationship, if either person\u2019s spouse or parent/guardian files a criminal complaint, then both parties of an extra-marital consensual relationship shall be liable to a jail sentence for a period not less than six months.</p>\n\n<p>If either person in a sexual relationship is under the age of 18 years, he/she is deemed a minor, and the other person over the age of 18 will be prosecuted for having a sexual relationship with a minor. If both people are under 18 years of age they will both be prosecuted but punishment is likely to be limited to a caution, parental supervision, judicial supervision, professional training or psychiatric treatment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"same-sex-relationships\">Same-sex relationships</h3>\n\n<p>All homosexual sex is illegal and same-sex marriages are not recognised.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is in many respects a tolerant society and private life is respected, although there have been some reports of individuals being punished for homosexual activity, particularly where there is any public element, or the behaviour has caused offence. This applies both to expatriate residents and to tourists.

Hobbies like bird watching and plane spotting, may be misunderstood - particularly near military sites, government buildings and airports.</p>\n\n<p>Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that is critical of the UAE government, companies or individuals, or related to incidents in the UAE, or appearing to abuse/ridicule/criticise the country or its authorities, or that is culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime punishable under UAE law. There have been cases of individuals being detained, prosecuted and/or convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to carry out media activity related to the production, transmission and/or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video and/or visual information, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permission from the Emirati authorities in advance. Failure to do so could result in arrest and deportation from the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Further information about how to obtain the necessary permits to carry out media activity in the UAE and bring media equipment into the UAE can be accessed by registering on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eservices.mcy.gov.ae/#/app/MediaLicenseServices/mediaLicense/review/732735\">Media Regulatory Office website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fundraisingcharitable-acts\">Fundraising/charitable acts</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering undertaking or promoting fundraising or other acts of charity in (or while passing through) the UAE, bear in mind that these activities, including where conducted online and via social media, are heavily regulated. You should be fully aware of the legal requirements and seek professional advice as necessary. Non-compliance can incur criminal penalties, including heavy fines and/or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buyingproperty\">Buying\u00a0property</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to buy property in the UAE, you should seek appropriate professional advice, as you would in the UK.\u00a0A list of lawyers for Abu Dhabi and Dubai is available on the <a href=\"/guidance/how-to-buy-property-in-the-uae\">British Embassy website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crime\">Financial crime</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud and the non-payment of bills (including hotel bills) can often result in imprisonment and/or a fine. Bank accounts and other assets can also be frozen.</p>\n\n<p>Bail is generally not available to non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for financial crimes. Those convicted will not generally be released from jail until the debt is paid or waived and they may even remain in jail after a debt has been paid if there is an outstanding sentence to be served.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"weapons-and-related-equipment\">Weapons and related equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Weapons, ammunition, body protection and related equipment (like cleaning kits, gun belts, etc), however small the quantity and whatever the purpose, all require permission before entering or transiting the UAE.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-equipment\">Technical equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Equipment like satellite phones, listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras or binoculars, may require a licence for use in the UAE.

No application in advance of travel is needed. Your passport will be stamped with the visa as you pass through Immigration. The visa issued at the airport for British passport holders is valid for up to 40 days.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFAIC) has a visa hotline: +971 (0)9 208 3344.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions on the validity or expiry of your visa, contact UAE Immigration directly.

If you don\u2019t get this permit and are caught working while on a visit visa, then you risk being jailed or fined and deported.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, including on how to stay in the UAE for longer than 60 days, visit the websites of the [https://www.mofaic.gov.ae/en/missions/london), the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gdrfad.gov.ae/en\">Naturalisation and Residency Department \u2013 Dubai</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://beta.smartservices.ica.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/login\">UAE Federal E-Government Portal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you apply for a residence visa, you will have to take a blood test. Those testing positive for HIV or hepatitis are detained and then deported. There is no appeal process.</p>\n\n<p>UAE employers may ask foreign employees to deposit their passports with the company as part of the terms and conditions of employment. While this is not an unusual practice, it is illegal under UAE labour law.</p>\n\n<p>You should cancel your work visa before leaving the UAE permanently. If you don\u2019t do this, you risk being reported for leaving the UAE without permission and could be arrested if you return to the UAE, even if you are in transit to another country. Failure to repay debts or resolve any outstanding cases against you may also result in your arrest on return or transit through the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any doubt about your status before returning to the UAE seek advice from a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-lawyers\">local lawyer</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medication\">Medication</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel with any prescribed or over the counter medicines for personal use, you\u2019ll need to meet the UAE\u2019s specific requirements for your medicine to be allowed into the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering the country with medication that the UAE classes as narcotic, psychotropic, controlled or semi-controlled, approval is needed from the UAE authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Approval should be requested in advance.

The UAE authorities advise that applications are normally processed within 5 working days.</p>\n\n<p>If you arrive in the UAE without prior approval or the required documentation, the medication will not be allowed into the UAE and you may be prosecuted under UAE law. If you need more information on controlled medicines or the process for obtaining permission, you should contact the UAE Ministry of Health by emailing <a href=\"mailto:info@moh.gov.ae\">info@moh.gov.ae</a> or calling +971 800 11111.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in transit through a UAE airport and do not intend entering the UAE, or are entering the UAE with other types of medicine, you\u2019re not required to go through this approval process.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, there are limits on the amount of medication that can be brought into the UAE legally. The Ministry of Health advise that you can bring up to 3 months\u2019 supply of medication as a visitor, reduced to one month\u2019s supply if the medication is included in the list requiring approval.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-israel\">Previous travel to Israel</h3>\n\n<p>UAE immigration authorities have advised that British nationals with valid or expired Israeli visas or stamps in their passports should not face any difficulties entering the UAE as long as they don\u2019t intend to work. If you do intend to work, further checks may be required and there is a risk that entry may be refused.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British-Israeli dual national and have any concerns about entering the UAE, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sp.mofaic.gov.ae/EN/DiplomaticMissions/Embassies/London/Pages/home.aspx\">Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in London</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regular-exit-requirements\">Regular exit requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors must have legal status in the UAE when they depart.

Further disturbances could occur with little or no warning and impact other Black people perceived to be of sub-Saharan African origin.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. There have been a number of self-initiated attacks in 2023. On 3 July a National Guard officer was attacked with a knife in the La Goulette area of Tunis.</p>\n\n<p>In June, a police officer was stabbed and killed outside the Brazilian Embassy in Tunis. In May, a fatal shooting took place on the island of Djerba, near to where Tunisian and international visitors were taking part in the annual Jewish pilgrimage at the El Ghriba synagogue. Three security personnel and two civilians were killed, and ten people were injured.</p>\n\n<p>Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one.

They usually take place in central areas of Tunis and other major cities, and in the vicinity of government buildings, often but not always on weekends or around prominent national anniversary dates. In response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, peaceful demonstrations have occurred in some Tunisian cities, including outside some Western embassies. Avoid all protests, and move away from gathered crowds. Keep up to date with developments through the media and follow the instructions given by the Tunisian authorities as well as your hotel and tour operator, if you have one.

In response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, peaceful demonstrations have occurred in some Tunisian cities, including outside some Western embassies.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid demonstrations and protests wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent. If you do find yourself unexpectedly near a demonstration or protest, move away from the area.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep up to date with developments through the media and follow the instructions given by the Tunisian authorities as well as your hotel and tour operator, if you have one.</p>\n\n<p>Strikes take place in Tunisia periodically, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders.</p>\n\n<p>Curfews can be imposed at short notice in response to events. You should follow the guidance of local authorities when travelling around the country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>You should check the latest guidance of local authorities and subscribe to the Travel Advice updates before moving around the country, to be aware of local events taking place and how that might impact your internal travel.</p>\n\n<p>Mobile phone coverage can be patchy or unavailable in more remote areas, particularly in the south of Tunisia. Check before travelling, and/or consider downloading maps for offline use.</p>\n\n<p>Some online or GPS maps may not be accurate in remote areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened Tunisian security presence at the borders with Libya and Algeria due to cross border terrorist activity and fighting in Libya. Border crossings are sometimes closed temporarily without notice. Some violent incidents have occurred.</p>\n\n<p>See FCDO travel advice for <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya\">Libya</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/algeria\">Algeria</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"chaambi-mountains\">Chaambi Mountains</h3>\n\n<p>The FCDO advise against all travel to the Chaambi Mountains National Park area, as well as Mount Salloum, Mount Sammamma, and Mount Mghila (all designated military operations zones). The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to all other areas within 10km of Mount Mghila.</p>\n\n<p>Tunisian security forces continue to conduct operations. Security personnel have been killed and severely wounded in attacks and by booby-trap explosives in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Incidents of mugging, pick pocketing, bag-snatching and petty theft occur. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Where possible, avoid carrying all your important documents, money and other valuables in the same bag. You should remain alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks are rare but they do occur.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several recent reports of assaults and theft in Tunis. \n Harassment of foreign women in Tunis is also reported to have increased.  These have occurred in a variety of areas, including busy public places at night, and quieter public parks and beaches during the daytime.</p>\n\n<p>You are advised to maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK and take care when walking or travelling alone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-screenings\">Security screenings</h2>\n\n<p>Some British nationals of South Asian descent have been subject to additional screening or refused entry by immigration authorities at airports, including Enfidha, on alleged security grounds. See entry requirements for further details.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discrimination-and-harassment\">Discrimination and harassment</h2>\n\n<p>Though not commonly experienced by visitors, racial discrimination may be an issue, particularly in public places. Following public comments on irregular migration in February 2023, there was a temporary spike in verbal and physical assaults against those thought to be sub-Saharan African migrants. There have also been recent anti-migrant protests in certain coastal towns, including Sfax.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Tunisia with a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year. You will need to have a 1968 IDP to drive in Tunisia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Tunisia. You can only get IDPs over the counter from UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Tunisia, it may be possible to drive on a UK licence for up to one year, providing that you meet a number of conditions and submit an application to the Tunisian Ministry of Transport. Please check the conditions and application process with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.attt.com.tn/page.php?code_menu=39\">Tunisian Ministry of Transport</a>. For any longer periods, you will need to apply for a Tunisian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Tunisia.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards can be erratic. There is very little lane discipline and often confusion about the right of way, especially at roundabouts. There are few pedestrian crossings and traffic lights are sometimes ignored. Take care when driving in towns as pedestrians tend to walk on the roads and have the right of way. Take particular care when crossing roads on foot, even where there is a signal allowing you to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are of a reasonable standard although large potholes can appear quickly following heavy rain, and most towns and villages have large speed bumps.</p>\n\n<p>Driving at night can be hazardous particularly out of towns due to a lack of road lighting, unlighted vehicles, and animals on the roads in rural areas. Exercise caution and slow down when approaching sand drifts on roads.</p>\n\n<p>You may come across military or police security checks. If you do, approach slowly, don\u2019t cross boundaries without permission and be prepared to present photo ID if asked.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations can occasionally affect road travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should check the availability of fuelling stations before travelling long distances in remote areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Rail travel is generally safe, although safety standards tend to be lower than those in the UK. There is a risk of petty crime on trains.</p>\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">terrorism</a>\u00a0while abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Libya-based extremists with links to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). Despite some improvements in border security, Tunisia has a porous border with Libya, where there is a continuing conflict, an absence of security, and where Islamist terrorist groups operate. Tunisian security forces have repeatedly been targeted in terrorist-related incidents, mainly in border areas including in the Chaambi Mountains.</p>\n\n<p>A nationwide state of emergency, first imposed after a suicide attack on a police bus in November 2015, remains in place. Follow the advice of local security officials, including in and around religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation interests. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Tunisia to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>The Tunisian authorities regularly report that they have disrupted planned attacks and terrorist cells and made arrests. The Tunisian authorities have improved security in tourist resorts and their ability to respond to a terrorist incident. Tunisian security forces have also improved and are better prepared to tackle terrorist threats than they were at the time of the 2015 attacks. But further attacks remain likely, including in places visited by foreigners such as tourist resorts. Attacks may be carried out by individuals unknown to the authorities, whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups.  There have been a number of self-initiated attacks in recent months.</p>\n\n<p>Recent incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 3 July a National Guard officer was stabbed in a knife attack in the Goulette area of Tunis.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in May 2023, a fatal shooting took place on the island of Djerba, near where Tunisian and international visitors were taking part in the annual Jewish pilgrimage at the El Ghriba synagogue. Three security personnel and two civilians were killed, and ten people were injured.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2022, two security officers were injured in a knife attack by an assailant near a synagogue in central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in January 2022, January three passengers on a tram at Bab Alioua station in Tunis were injured after a knife attack.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in November 2021, police shot and wounded an assailant who attacked them with a knife and axe in front of the Interior Ministry on Habib Bourguiba avenue, central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in September 2020, two officers of Tunisia\u2019s National Guard were attacked by three assailants in Sousse. Security forces later killed all three attackers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in March 2020, a suicide bombing targeting a police patrol near the US Embassy in Tunis killed one police officer and injured four more, as well as a civilian.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in October 2019, a French national was stabbed to death in Zarzouna, northern Tunisia, by an individual who then attacked a Tunisian soldier.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2019, there were 2 suicide bombings targeting security personnel in central Tunis; 3 people, including the perpetrators, were killed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in October 2018, 15 security personnel and 5 civilians were injured in a bombing on Avenue Habib Bourguiba in central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in July 2018, militants attacked security forces near Ghardimaou, close to the Algerian border. A number of Tunisian National Guard officers were killed. This follows separate media reports in early July 2018 of Tunisian security forces disrupting a terrorist group in Hammamet.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2015, 38 foreign tourists were killed, including 30 British nationals, in a terrorist attack at Port El Kantaoui near Sousse.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>in March 2015, 21 tourists were killed, including a British national, in a terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum in the centre of Tunis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Some protests in recent years have turned violent or been violently suppressed by the authorities. Avoid all protests.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpockets and bag snatchers operate in crowded areas and places visited by tourists. Take care of your belongings and consider splitting important items between bags.</p>\n\n<p>Do not give your passport to others as a guarantee \u2013 for example, to motorcycle rental shops or landlords. Companies can hold your passport against claimed damage.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of petty theft on buses and trains, particularly while asleep on overnight trains.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals have reported rape and sexual assaults in tourist areas and places where foreigners live. Women have also reported indecent assaults and harassment. These include inappropriate touching and groping, particularly while walking alone.</p>\n\n<p>In Vietnam there is a higher burden of proof for victims than in the UK. Victims must show they did not consent, particularly if they drank alcohol or knew the alleged attacker.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-in-vietnam-information-for-victims\">information for rape and sexual assault victims in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be cautious about offers of free bus transfers to hotels, unless organised in advance. These may be scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines-and-unexploded-weapons\">Landmines and unexploded weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard in former battlefields. Areas of particular risk include central Vietnam and along the Laos border, formerly crossed by the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to always carry photographic ID. You should carry a photocopy of the photo page of your passport with your personal details and visa and leave the original in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for possessing, distributing or manufacturing drugs are severe. You can get a death sentence if you\u2019re found with even small amounts.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal drugs are often tampered with or spiked and can be much stronger than in Europe. British nationals in Vietnam have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Vietnam is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are no criminal penalties for same-sex relationships and changing gender. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by law.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Respect local customs and dress in appropriate clothing when entering religious or cultural sites. This usually means covering your shoulders and knees. Signs informing you of the dress code outside religious or cultural sites are common.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money-change-counters\">Money change counters</h3>\n\n<p>Only change money at official money exchange counters with a clear sign showing this status. Changing money elsewhere is illegal and you risk losing your money.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rice-wine\">Rice wine</h3>\n\n<p>Some rice wines sold without recognised brand names can have very high and sometimes fatal levels of methanol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or collect protected wild animal or plants. If you\u2019re caught buying or trafficking these items, you could get a fine or long prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"restricted-areas\">Restricted areas</h3>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on travel near military bases.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to visit a village, commune or ward close to the border, you may need permission from the provincial police department. Contact the local authority for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-near-military-bases\">Using cameras near military bases</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photos near military bases in Vietnam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-system\">Legal system</h3>\n\n<p>Crimes like sex and drug offences can attract very long prison terms or a death sentence. The Vietnamese legal system is not well developed, and the standard of prisons is very poor.</p>\n\n<p>Reporting a crime to the police can be a long and difficult process. Consider taking a Vietnamese-speaking person with you to assist with the translation. You\u2019ll usually have to sign documents in Vietnamese. Take care to only sign accurately translated documents. Find an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/translators-interpreters?country=Vietnam\">English-speaking translator or interpreter in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are under criminal investigation, you can be detained for long periods without evidence. There can be long delays before you can contact lawyers, British consular officials or family. Legal representation is far below UK standards.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals involved in traffic accidents have been stopped from leaving Vietnam until the police have completed their investigations. This process can take a long time, and foreign nationals have been asked to agree out of court financial settlements. FCDO advises you to get professional legal advice and representation if you are in this situation. Find an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/lawyers?country=Vietnam\">English-speaking lawyer in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"internet-access\">Internet access</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes restrictions on internet use, which can temporarily affect access to social media websites. Most social media sites are normally available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals have died or been injured in Vietnam while engaged in adventure tourism in rural and mountainous areas.</p>\n\n<p>Risks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>dangerous terrain</li>\n  <li>remote areas that are difficult for rescue services to reach</li>\n  <li>flooding, swollen rivers and landslides, especially during the rainy season</li>\n  <li>lower safety standards than in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow safety guidelines</li>\n  <li>stay on main routes</li>\n  <li>take a reputable guide \u2013 in some places it is illegal to go without a guide</li>\n  <li>use approved adventure tourism companies - check local authority websites</li>\n  <li>check weather forecasts</li>\n  <li>make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Illegal tour guides have been known to offer tours and activities prohibited under local regulations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"firearms-activities\">Firearms activities</h3>\n\n<p>If you take part in leisure activities involving firearms, make sure a reputable guide supervises you. There is a risk of hearing loss.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Vietnam, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldriversassociation.com/vietnam-driving-guide/\">driving rules in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car.</p>\n\n<p>Compliance with road laws is poor \u2013 keep your speed down and stay alert.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive without third-party insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Vietnam. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Do not use your passport as a deposit for hiring vehicles or as a guarantee you will pay a fine for a traffic offence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident or subject to an investigation, you could face criminal charges and may need to pay compensation to injured people, even if the injuries are minor. Offer the police your full co-operation and inform the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-hanoi\">British Embassy in Hanoi</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-ho-chi-minh-city\">Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorbike-safety\">Motorbike safety</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by motorbike in Vietnam is much riskier than in the UK. Motorbike accidents are common and have killed and injured British nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Do not drive a motorbike if you\u2019re not an experienced rider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive a motorbike, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check your motorbike thoroughly</li>\n  <li>rent from a reputable organisation</li>\n  <li>use a good helmet \u2013 it is illegal for drivers and passengers to ride without a helmet</li>\n  <li>know the roads on which you plan to travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Metered taxis from larger firms are generally reliable. There are many taxi operators and meters are set at different prices. The meter should start at around 8,000 to 20,000 Vietnamese dong, depending on the size of the taxi and the taxi company.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible get hotels or restaurants to book you a reputable taxi. Always make sure the driver identifies themself before setting off. If you book a taxi online or through an app, make sure the details of the vehicle and driver match those given by the company.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of overcharging for taxi journeys in tourist areas like the Old Quarter of Hanoi, Hanoi airport and Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s airport. For added peace of mind, book taxis using the Grab app, which is similar to Uber.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coaches\">Buses and coaches</h3>\n\n<p>Bus and coach crashes are not uncommon and more likely at night. Vehicles are often poorly maintained. Night bus drivers may become tired but continue driving, resulting in sometimes fatal crashes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Safety regulations and standards vary and are not the same as in the UK. Check with your tour guide about the safety record and registration of boats, and the certification of staff. Make sure you get a full safety briefing and have a life jacket when joining any boat.</p>\n\n<p>Consider safety standards carefully before taking an overnight boat trip on Halong Bay. Some boats have sunk quickly and without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in coastal areas of Vietnam is very rare. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">piracy and armed robbery at sea</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"tropical-cyclones\">Tropical cyclones</h3>\n\n<p>Tropical cyclones affect the eastern coastal regions of Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>Risks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>strong winds</li>\n  <li>heavy rainfall</li>\n  <li>flooding</li>\n  <li>disruption to transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The season normally runs from May to November, but tropical cyclones can happen at other times. Monitor approaching storms on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nchmf.gov.vn/KttvsiteE/en-US/2/index.html\">National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html#5/34.5/137/&amp;elem=root&amp;typhoon=all&amp;contents=typhoon&amp;lang=en\">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> websites. Follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Vietnam has a tropical monsoon climate. There can be large amounts of rain in short periods of time. Localised flooding, flash floods and landslides are common. Take care if you are trekking in rural and mountainous areas.</p>\n",
