You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-morocco\">Terrorism in Morocco</h3>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Two tourists were murdered while hiking near Mount Toubkal in 2018. Moroccan authorities arrested four individuals in connection with the murders, including one who had links to \u201can extremist group\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increased threat linked to the number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh (formerly ISIL) and other extremist groups. Authorities regularly disrupt terrorist cells.</p>\n\n<p>Places at higher risk of attack include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>crowded areas</li>\n  <li>government installations</li>\n  <li>transportation networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with Western interests</li>\n  <li>areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Protective security measures, including security guards, may be present in areas, including hotels and sites popular with tourists.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>While there have been no recent kidnappings of foreign nationals in Morocco, it cannot be ruled out. There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Libya</li>\n  <li>Mauritania</li>\n  <li>groups originating in the Sahel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel illegally across the border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in the border and remote desert areas of North Africa. This has been done for financial gain and for political leverage.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have kidnapped:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>foreigners</li>\n  <li>government officials</li>\n  <li>civilians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those working in the tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a currently a heightened chance of demonstrations and protests occurring across the country. You should avoid these gatherings, and be aware of the potential for protests to occur spontaneously. Protests can happen at short notice and are generally heavily policed. Demonstrations are mostly peaceful but there has been isolated violence. Demonstrations and protests may lead to increased travel disruption in affected areas.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any media reporting and instructions from local security authorities. Avoid political gatherings and demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"borders\">Borders</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"western-sahara\">Western Sahara</h3>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/western-sahara\">travel advice for Western Sahara</a> if you plan to travel to this disputed territory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"algerian-border\">Algerian border</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to cross an international border without authorisation. The land and maritime border between Morocco and Algeria is closed. The border is patrolled and monitored closely by the authorities. Do not attempt to cross the border.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in a boat or jet ski, ensure you know where the maritime border is and remain clearly within Moroccan waters. Ensure you have enough fuel to return to shore. As happened in August 2023, individuals entering Algerian waters illegally are likely to be intercepted and investigated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of violent crime occasionally happen. There have been incidents involving the use of knives against tourists in street attacks, thefts and burglaries in major cities and along beaches. Avoid quiet areas, particularly after dark. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"petty-crime\">Petty crime</h3>\n\n<p>Petty crime is common, especially in tourist areas like the medina quarter (historical district) of towns/cities and on beaches. Crimes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>pickpocketing</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>bag snatching</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>drive-by motorcycle theft of visible jewellery and handbags</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be vigilant when asking for directions and using ATMs as crime and aggressive begging can happen. Credit card fraud and scams like substituting inferior goods for those that were bought are common. Remain alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"harassment-of-tourists\">Harassment of tourists</h2>\n\n<p>Harassment of tourists by people posing as official tourist guides is common.</p>\n\n<p>When visiting the medina quarter (historical district) of a town or city, make sure any guide you use is operating with the agreement of the local tourist authorities, and displays an official badge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"marriage-fraud\">Marriage fraud</h2>\n\n<p>Be cautious when travelling to Morocco for a relationship, or to meet someone you met on the internet. There have been incidents of marriage fraud and attempted extortion affecting British nationals. Make sure you keep your return ticket, passport and personal belongings safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"islamic-laws-and-customs\">Islamic laws and customs</h3>\n\n<p>Morocco is a Muslim country, which follows Islamic laws and customs. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be aware of your actions to ensure they don\u2019t offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas (see below)</li>\n  <li>respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions</li>\n  <li>avoid public displays of affection, particularly outside the main tourist areas and near religious places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sexual relations outside marriage are punishable by law. Hotels can ask couples to show evidence of marriage while checking-in and, if you don\u2019t have proof, they can insist on separate rooms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country, check when Ramadan is in Morocco before you go. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Morocco. Be sensitive to local laws and customs and avoid public displays of affection. Complaints can lead to prosecution. See FCDO\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a> .</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"women-travellers\">Women travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Women, especially when travelling alone, may receive unwanted attention from men.  Consider wearing loose-fitting clothing which cover the arms, legs and chest. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">FCDO advice for woman travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Alcohol is served in licensed hotels, bars and in tourist areas. Drinking alcohol in the street and anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar is illegal and can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in a lengthy prison sentence and a heavy fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sending-passports-in-the-post\">Sending passports in the post</h3>\n\n<p>In Morocco, it\u2019s illegal to send passports through the post. British passports sent to or through Morocco by post or courier companies will be confiscated by the Moroccan authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bibles-and-religious-literature\">Bibles and religious literature</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to carry bibles in Arabic, to attempt to distribute any non-Muslim or evangelical literature, or to be involved in any such activity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras\">Using cameras</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking any photographs near sensitive political or military sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pornographic-material\">Pornographic material</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to possess pornographic material. Possession of recorded writings, printed matter, cassettes and videocassettes and any type of material contrary to morality and public order are prohibited in the Moroccan territory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flying-drones\">Flying drones</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need permission from the authorities to fly a drone. Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.aviationcivile.gov.ma/\">Directorate General for Civial Aviation</a> (in French) for more information about the rules.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Many taxis bookable via mobile phone apps may be unregulated and unlicensed. Drivers may not be registered with the authorities and their vehicle may not have the appropriate levels of insurance for carrying passengers. Such taxis may at times be stopped by the police, who may ask you get out of the car.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>think carefully before using such unregulated or unlicensed taxis</li>\n  <li>use normal \u2018Petits\u2019 or \u2018Grands Taxis\u2019 where possible</li>\n  <li>avoid sharing taxis with other passengers that you do not know</li>\n  <li>insist against sharing if your driver tries to pick up other passengers during your journey</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</h3>\n\n<p>You need either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Morocco for up to one year. 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you are staying in Morocco for longer than one year, you need to apply for a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://consulat.ma/en/driving-license\">Moroccan Driving License</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-insurance\">Car insurance</h3>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a>, which can be obtained from your car insurer, is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Morocco.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-conditions\">Road conditions</h2>\n\n<p>Drive carefully, especially when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>driving at night, which be particularly dangerous  due to poor lighting</li>\n  <li>the weather conditions are poor on secondary routes and mountain roads</li>\n  <li>overtaking lorries and trucks that are overloaded and when there is no hard shoulder</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-accidents\">Road accidents</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, complete a form (\u2018constat amiable\u2019), to be signed by both parties. Blank forms are available on arrival at Tangier port from the insurance company booths and from tobacconists in all cities.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident resulting in a fatality and the Moroccan authorities consider you responsible, you may be detained pending a trial hearing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vehicle-documentation\">Vehicle documentation</h2>\n\n<p>If you enter Morocco with a vehicle, the registration number will be recorded.

House burglaries, often by armed gangs, are common. Hold-ups and robberies of restaurants during peak hours have also occurred in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Theft from parked cars does occur and thieves target cars waiting at traffic lights to smash and grab handbags, phones or laptops. Keep valuables out of sight and in a safe place. If you\u2019re attacked, do not resist. Use a hotel safe, where practical. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place.</p>\n\n<p>There have been isolated room break-ins and robbery from lodges in the Chobe area, particularly river-fronting lodges. Lock your room when you can and secure valuables.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidences of rape and other sexual offences. Seek immediate medical advice if you\u2019re sexually assaulted or otherwise injured. Women, in particular, should not walk alone at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>You should avoid large demonstrations and gatherings. In 2011 police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Game reserves and other tourist areas are generally secure, but be alert to unpredictable behaviour by wild animals. Follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice. Avoid bathing in rivers and lakes, because of the dangers from both wildlife and water-borne diseases.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to remote areas plan your trip carefully, make transport and accommodation arrangements in advance and seek local security advice. Take emergency supplies (including water and fuel) and be prepared for off-road driving conditions. In very remote areas travel in convoy or with a satellite phone in case of breakdown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive using an\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit</a>\u00a0for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer you should apply for a Botswana driving license.</p>\n\n<p>Botswana has good tarmac roads covering most of the country but you should be careful when driving. The standard of driving is lower than in the UK and many drivers ignore road safety rules. Dangerous driving, including speeding (the maximum speed limit is 120kmh) and drink/drug driving, cause frequent serious and often fatal accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Driving, particularly outside the major urban areas, can be dangerous due to stray wildlife and livestock. This is a particular risk at night, so take extra care if you\u2019re driving after dark.</p>\n\n<p>In major towns taxis are generally safe to take. You should agree a price before setting off.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>If you have checked this Travel Advice and still need assistance from the British High Commission Gaborone, you can contact us via our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Botswana&amp;post=British%20High%20Commission%20Gaborone\">Online Enquiry Form</a>. If you need emergency assistance, you should call +267 395 2841.</p>\n\n<p>Botswana authorities do not always inform the British High Commission when British nationals have been arrested. If you\u2019re detained, you may insist on your right to contact a British consular officer and have access to lawyer. There is currently no comprehensive legal aid scheme and you would need to pay for any lawyer yourself.</p>\n",

For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to the UK or South Africa may be necessary. Private hospitals will not treat patients unless you can pay, and the cost of health care may be high. Outpatients must pay cash before receiving treatment. You will only be accepted as an emergency patient if you have full insurance cover. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gov.bw/en/News/rabies-outbreak-hits-ngamiland/\">rabies</a> outbreak was reported in Ngamiland, in the Delta area of north west Botswana on 8 November.

Do not touch dead animals or carcasses. If you suspect that you have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to camp or walk in the bush you should be aware of the risk of tick bites.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 997 and ask for an ambulance.

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Recent terrorist attacks in Spain include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in January 2023, one person was killed and others injured in a machete attack at 2 churches in Cadiz</li>\n  <li>in 2017, 14 people were killed and over 100 injured across 2 incidents where vehicles were driven into pedestrians in Barcelona and Cambrils</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Demonstrations, political gatherings or marches can take place with little or no warning, particularly in cities. Follow the advice of police and local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>While most demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of unrest or violence. If you\u2019re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, be aware of what is happening around you and move away if there are signs of disorder.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Spain are trouble-free, but be alert to street crime. Thieves use distraction techniques, and often work in teams. Take care of your passports, money and personal belongings, particularly when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire.</p>\n\n<p>Do not carry all your valuables in one place. Keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has adequate security. Lock all doors and windows at night, or when out. If concerned about the security of your accommodation, speak to your travel operator or the property owner.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>\u2018Highway pirates\u2019 target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. They may (forcefully) try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of a vehicle, stop in a public area with lights, such as a service station. Be wary of anyone offering help.</p>\n\n<p>When driving, be wary of approaches by people posing as police officers in plain clothes travelling in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will usually be in uniform. All police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID. Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads Police (\u2018Polic\u00eda\u2019) or Civil Guard (\u2018Guardia Civil\u2019), and may use blue flashing lights. Genuine police officers will only ask you to show them your documents and will not ask for your bag or wallet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attacks-and-sexual-assault\">Attacks and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>In an emergency call 112.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur.

Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars in Spain are often stronger than those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves posing as police officers may ask to see your wallet, claiming they need to see it for identification. Genuine police officers will ask to see ID, but will not ask for wallets or purses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"timeshare-and-holiday-clubs\">Timeshare and holiday clubs</h3>\n\n<p>Timeshare ownership is well established in Spain. There are respected companies, agents and resorts who operate legally and fairly. However, there are also unscrupulous companies who falsely claim to provide incentives.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z-of-fraud/timeshare-fraud\">Read timeshare fraud advice from Action Fraud</a>, the UK\u2019s national fraud reporting centre.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must provide photo ID if requested by a police officer. This includes the Guardia Civil and national, regional and local police forces. The police have the right to hold you at a police station until they have confirmed your identity.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring direct requests of a police officer can be considered as \u2018disobedience\u2019, which is a criminal offence.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels, tourist accommodation and car rental companies have a legal duty to register passport details of tourists when they check-in or collect a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>When checking-in to your accommodation, wait until hotel staff have registered your passport details, or taken a photocopy of your passport. Do not leave your passport at reception to collect later.</p>\n\n<p>You may need to show ID when buying goods with credit or debit cards. Your driving licence or a photocopy of your passport may be accepted, but they may need you to show your original passport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>You cannot drink alcohol in the street in some areas of Spain. You can be given an on-the-spot fine. There are strict controls on drinking and sexual activity in public places, including on beaches.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-in-the-balearic-islands\">Alcohol laws in the Balearic Islands</h3>\n\n<p>Local laws limit the sale and availability of alcohol in areas of some resorts on the islands of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Mallorca</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Magaluf (Calvi\u00e0)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Playa de Palma</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Ibiza</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>San Antonio (San Antoni de Portmany)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This prohibits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>happy hours</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>open bars (such as all you can drink in 1-hour offers)</li>\n  <li>the sale of alcohol from vending machines</li>\n  <li>self-service alcohol dispensers</li>\n  <li>the organising of pub-crawls and party boat trips</li>\n  <li>\u2018off-licence\u2019 sales between 9:30pm and 8am</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hotels and other establishments are obliged to evict customers who behave dangerously on balconies. Both the customer and the establishment can be fined for such behaviour.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possession of even a small quantity of drugs can lead to arrest and detention. Possession of large quantities will usually result in prosecution and a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-commercial-parties-in-villas-and-private-homes\">Illegal commercial parties in villas and private homes</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving people attending illegal commercially promoted parties in villas and private homes on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca.</p>\n\n<p>Licensed clubs and bars are required to meet safety and security standards, including emergency exits and capacity limits, and to have trained, licensed security staff. Illegal commercial parties may not meet these standards. Take care of your belongings, make sure you know where emergency exits are and do not take unnecessary risks.</p>\n\n<p>You may receive a fine for attending illegal commercially promoted parties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress\">Dress</h3>\n\n<p>In some parts of Spain it\u2019s against the law to be in the street wearing only a bikini or swimming shorts. Being bare-chested is also illegal in some areas in Spain. You may be fined if you\u2019re caught wearing swimwear on the seafront promenade or adjacent streets.</p>\n\n<p>For security reasons, some public authorities in Spain do not allow the burka or niqab to be worn in their buildings. If you visit town council buildings wearing a burka or niqab, you may be asked to remove it while inside.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"changing-money\">Changing money</h3>\n\n<p>When changing money, always use official money exchange offices or banks because unofficial money changers may give you counterfeit money. Possession or use of counterfeit money is considered a serious crime in Spain and may lead to prosecution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Spain is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are active LGBT+ communities and social venues, particularly in big cities. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Spain since 2005. Since 2007, transgender people are able to register under their preferred sex in public documents such as birth certificates, identity cards and passports without undergoing prior gender reassignment surgery. Spain does not recognise a third gender.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"falls-from-height\">Falls from height</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from height, including balconies. Many accidents have involved British nationals, and have had a devastating impact on those involved and their loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>Do not take unnecessary risks around balconies or other high places, particularly if you\u2019re under the influence of drink or drugs. If you are staying in a room with a balcony, follow the safety advice and watch out for friends who may be at risk.</p>\n\n<p>In some regions you may be fined or evicted from your hotel if you are found to be behaving irresponsibly around balconies. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place on a balcony or if you were under the influence of drink or drugs when the incident happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"festivals-concerts-and-processions\">Festivals, concerts and processions</h3>\n\n<p>Many large events and public processions are held in Spain each year. Follow the advice of police and local authorities when attending events.</p>\n\n<p>Take care of your valuables if attending a festival or large concert. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/festival-travel-checklist\">See the festival travel checklist</a> for more advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-and-beaches\">Swimming and beaches</h3>\n\n<p>Every year, people drown in the sea and in swimming pools in Spain. Children should always be supervised, even if they can swim or there is a lifeguard present.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming in the sea. Some beaches, especially around Spanish islands, may have strong undercurrents.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid swimming at beaches that are close to rivers. Do not dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death.</p>\n\n<p>Many beaches have a flag system. Make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you must not enter the water). Take extra care and seek local knowledge if there are no lifeguards, flags or signs.</p>\n\n<p>If you are walking along unmanned beaches, be aware that waves can come in further than expected and have strong undertows.</p>\n\n<p>Further tips can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">ABTA\u2019s swim safe pages</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">Royal Life Saving Society\u2019s \u2018Water Safety on Holiday\u2019</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hill-walking-skiing-and-mountain-activities\">Hill walking, skiing and mountain activities</h3>\n\n<p>Temperatures in some parts of Spain can change very quickly.

Licensing regulations differ across Spain and in certain cities pre-booking is required.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers caught using unlicensed taxi services are liable for fines of up to 600 Euros. Make sure you book your taxi or airport transfer through a licensed firm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Spain, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/spain/\">read the RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021 there were 1,508 road deaths in Spain (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/reported-road-accidents-vehicles-and-casualties-tables-for-great-britain\">source: Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 32 road deaths per million population and compares to the UK average of 24 road deaths per million population in 2021.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>To drive a car or a motorcycle over 125cc in Spain you must be 18 years of age or above, and at least 16 years old to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc.

Check that your UK insurance will cover you to drive in Spain, and for how long. This certificate is generally only valid for a stay of less than 3 months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. In 2021 UK stickers replaced GB stickers. Check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>Motorists drive on the right-hand side of the road in Spain. Driving rules and customs are different from those in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry 2 red warning triangles which, in the event of an accident or breakdown should be placed in front of and behind the vehicle. They should be at least 50 metres away from the vehicle in each direction. You must have a spare wheel and the tools to change it.

Only completely hands-free units are allowed to be used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"low-emission-zones\">Low emission zones</h3>\n\n<p>Some inner city areas in Spain have introduced permanent low emission zones (\u2018Zonas de bajas emisiones\u2019 \u2013 ZBE) where only vehicles that meet specific exhaust emission standards and display an air pollution sticker can enter. While air pollution stickers cannot be issued to vehicles with foreign registration plates, some cities do require you to register your vehicle in advance of travel if you wish to enter a low emission zone (e.g. Barcelona). You should check with local authorities in advance of travel for information on local regulations and the requirements for vehicles registered outside of Spain.</p>\n\n<p>The Spanish government\u2019s general information helpline 060 (if calling in Spain) or +34 902 887 060 (if calling from UK) may be able to provide further information.</p>\n\n<p>Some cities also operate emergency anti-pollution protocols to limit exhaust emissions when air pollution levels are high.

In Niue, you must apply for a local driving licence from the Police Department. Distances around the three Atolls of Tokelau are short and can be covered by boat and on foot.</p>\n\n<p>Driving on islands in the South Pacific can be challenging, particularly at night. Road conditions and street lighting are poor and there are few footpaths.  Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.</p>\n\n<p>The legal blood alcohol limit for drivers and motorcyclists in the Cook Islands is 0.08. Do not drink and drive. Familiarise yourself with local traffic laws and practices before driving and drive defensively.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"watersports-and-adventure-activities\">Watersports and adventure activities</h2>\n\n<p>If you intend to hire motorbikes, jet skis or any other motorised vehicle, you should comply with local licensing laws. Talk to your travel insurer to check your insurance policy covers such activity and seek advice on any restrictions that may apply. You should wear a helmet when using motorbikes or scooters.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming, snorkelling and diving are common activities. Take local advice before swimming. At certain times of the year, some beaches in Niue are closed for traditional fishing activities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Maritime safety is a concern in some Pacific countries. The safety standards you might expect of transport operators in the UK may not be replicated in the Pacific. Sufficient safety equipment may not be provided and safety regulations are not always adhered to. Ferries are often overcrowded.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau follows New Zealand maritime standards. There are strict controls on the number of passengers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx?Query=all\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cook Islands.</p>\n\n<p>A list of accidents and incidents in the region can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/\">Aviation Safety Network website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is no airport on Tokelau. Access is by boat only.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>The Cook Islands are a Parliamentary democracy based on the UK model. Officially the Islands are an independent nation in free association with New Zealand, which  means the Cook Islands government has full executive powers.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau is a dependent territory of New Zealand. It has its own unique political institutions, including a national legislative body and an Executive Council. It runs its own elections every three years. The relationship between Tokelau and New Zealand is managed by the Administrator of Tokelau. This is a statutory position held by a New Zealand public servant, and appointed by the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Niue\u2019s system of government is based on the Westminster system. The Niue Assembly consists of 20 members, 14 of whom are elected by village constituencies and 6 from the common roll. The 20 members elect a Premier and the Premier selects three cabinet ministers from the 19. Members elect a Speaker from outside their ranks. A general election is held every three years.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation across the islands is generally calm.</p>\n\n",

You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you\u2019re travelling to and proof of accommodation during your stay in the Cook Islands. If you\u2019re staying longer than 31 days in The Cook Islands or Niue you may need a visa or entry on arrival permit. For Tokelau, permission normally needs to be acquired from the Taupulega (Council) and tickets have to be bought from the Tokelau office in Samoa for the boats. Space on the vessels is in high demand. The travel can be onerous in heavy seas.</p>\n\n<p>Extensions may be granted on a monthly basis for up to 5 months. For extensions, you will need to apply at least 2 weeks before your permit expires.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to join a tourist boat, yacht or other sea-going vessel to travel beyond the Cook Islands, you must apply for permission to enter via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration (MFAI).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-youre-transiting-through-new-zealand\">If you\u2019re transiting through New Zealand</h2>\n\n<p>Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important.

In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to mainland New Zealand is likely to be the only option for treatment. Make sure your insurance policy includes provision for medical evacuation and covers you for all eventualities, including for any pre-existing conditions and any adventure or watersports activities within your travel plans.</p>\n\n<p>Hospitals may not be as well-equipped as those in United Kingdom and may lack specialist equipment (including neo-natal equipment for premature babies).  Hospital payment may be required before any treatment is received. Outside the capital there may be limited capacity to respond to emergency situations. Not all Pacific islands have diver decompression chambers and divers needing emergency treatment may need medical evacuation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>There is a risk of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue. You should take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Check the relevant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/264/cook-islands-niue-tokelau\">TravelHealthPro country page</a> for more information and advice.</p>\n\n<p>Ciguatera is an illness caused by eating fish containing certain toxins. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes and sometimes serious illness. There is no way to tell whether fish has been contaminated, but reef fish tend to concentrate the toxins more than others. Deep water fish like tuna, mahi mahi or wahoo are better options.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water\">Water</h2>\n<p>In the Cook Islands, Rarotonga and Aitutaki have reticulated water supply systems.  Water usage is not charged. On the other islands of the Southern Group, limited reticulation is provided and augmented by rainwater catchment and storage. The atolls of the Northern Group rely on rainwater from roof catchments.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau and Niue\u2019s water supply is still at the household level. Rainwater harvesting from roofs is the primary source of water in Tokelau.  Boiling water and only drinking bottled water is strongly recommended.</p>\n\n",

If you do not have your <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> with you or you\u2019ve lost it, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-overseas-healthcare-services\">contact the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. An <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment.

Some areas of the Arctic are uncharted and ice-covered.

Arctic weather can, and does, affect travel, and you should be prepared for delays and cancellations.</p>\n\n<p>There is limited tourist accommodation around the international airport in Kangerlussuaq. During busy periods or when there is travel disruption, there may be no beds available unless you have booked ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Supply chains are limited and travel times are long. You should ensure you travel with sufficient prescription medication for all of your time in Greenland.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-faroe-islands\">The Faroe Islands</h3>\n\n<p>Smaller roads may be unpaved and winding.</p>\n\n<p>The weather can change quickly, and you should prepare appropriately for the activity you are planning.</p>\n\n",

Read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hgss.hr/en/\">Croatian Mountain Rescue tips on mountaineering</a>, follow their Twitter at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hrvatskaGSS\">Hrvatska GSS</a>, and see their maps. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112 for help from the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Croatia using your UK driving licence for up to 12 months. You don\u2019t need an International Driving Permit.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re driving in Croatia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/croatia/\">RAC Croatia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Croatian Automobile Association lists <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hak.hr/en#traffic-flow-and-road-conditions\">current traffic hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attacks-and-sexual-assaults-in-taxis\">Attacks and sexual assaults in taxis</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of sexual assaults in taxis or Ubers in Croatia. To reduce risk and help prevent potential assaults you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take a photo of the inside, where the number of the taxi is visible, and send to a friend or someone else</li>\n  <li>share your ride status on the Uber app</li>\n  <li>make a call while in the taxi telling someone which taxi it is and where you are going</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For local information and support, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/getting-help\">Getting help</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive with more than 0.05% of alcohol in your blood system.</p>\n\n<p>You must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have your headlights on and dipped when driving a car from 1 November until 31 March, even during daytime. For scooters and motorcycles, you must drive with dipped headlights year-round</li>\n  <li>use winter tyres between 15 November and 15 April</li>\n  <li>carry a fluorescent vest kept in the car, not in the boot. Wear the vest while attending to a breakdown</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You must not use a mobile phone while driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Do not drink alcohol if you\u2019re in charge of a yacht or boat. There are heavy penalties for being caught drunk in charge of a boat and a zero tolerance approach.</p>\n\n<p>It is a requirement that you sail by the most direct route to a port of entry upon entering territorial waters.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities can arrest you for entering a non-designated entry port without telling them. If you cannot use the correct entry port, contact the local harbour master or the police before entering.</p>\n\n<p>Register your presence on a boat in Croatia by filling in a police form <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mup.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/stranci/2022/Obrazac-prijave-i-odjave-smjestaja-boravista-i-prebivalista-za-drz-trecih-zemalja-(Obrazac-16a).pdf\">obrazac 16a</a>. The completed form must be handed in at a police station.</p>\n\n<p>All captains must have an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rya.org.uk/knowledge/abroad/icc\">International Certificate of Competence</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Follow media reports and the advice of local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Fires are common during Croatia\u2019s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. If you see a fire, call the emergency services on 112. If you\u2019re affected, follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 June to 31 October it is illegal to set outdoor fires and barbecues except in designated areas. Intentionally causing a fire is illegal in Croatia and you could be fined from approximately 2,000 to 20,000 euros, or even imprisoned.</p>\n\n<p>You can also be fined for unintentionally causing a fire. Properly extinguish cigarette ends and do not leave any rubbish behind, particularly empty bottles, as these are known to start fires. Fines in these cases have ranged from 260 to 1,200 euros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes in Croatia can be strong and cause deaths and damage to infrastructure. In recent years, there have been earthquakes in Zagreb and in Petrinja, near Sisak in central Croatia. Both caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and 8 people died. Heavily damaged buildings, which are not always signposted, may be unstable.</p>\n\n<p>There are small tremors several times a month throughout the year. Most pass without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"floods\">Floods</h3>\n\n<p>Flash floods can happen with very little warning and lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. There is the highest risk of flooding in central Croatia, between Karlovac and Slavonski Brod. Monitor weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n",

Demonstrations often happen around important national holidays, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising).

Tourists have been taken to cashpoints with demands for the money to pay the bill. Always ask to see the menu and price list before ordering drinks or food, and check your bill carefully before paying. Be wary of establishments where menus do not properly display prices. Report any incidents to the police.</p>\n\n<p>Some taxi drivers are part of these frauds. They may receive a commission to recommend certain bars, clubs and restaurants to passengers. If a taxi driver offers to take you to a bar or club, or you are approached on the street with an invitation, be cautious. Use taxis from a reputable local company.</p>\n\n<p>Use official <abbr title=\"Automated Teller Machines\">ATMs</abbr> or banks.

Budapest is generally tolerant and open.  Recent Pride events have passed without incident, but historically there have been counter-events which have led to verbal, and sometimes physical, confrontation.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Political and other   demonstrations have been held in central Tirana, with some reported incidents of violence. Demonstrations can cause traffic diversions and other disruption. Demonstrations could happen elsewhere, and may take place outside the capital city.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check local media for the latest information</li>\n  <li>avoid any demonstrations, large-scale gatherings or political rallies</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities as there is always a possibility demonstrations could turn violent</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tension between religious groups and expression of extremist views are very rare, and attitudes to western countries are generally very positive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Public security is generally good, particularly in Tirana, and Albanians are very hospitable to visitors. Crime and violence does happen in some areas, but reports of crime targeting foreigners are rare. There have been occasional shootings and small explosions related to internal disputes over criminal, business or political interests.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>When visiting hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo, you should take care, particularly if hiking, and follow the signs warning about unexploded landmines and other unexploded weapons. De-mining operations continue in Kosovo.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug-related crimes are severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"being-arrested\">Being arrested</h3>\n\n<p>The Albanian authorities do not always inform the British Embassy when British nationals have been arrested. If you are detained, you may insist on your right to contact a British consular officer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Albania.  Anti-discrimination and anti hate-crime legislation is in place. Tirana has several gay-friendly bars and a number of LGBT+ support groups.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>There are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/countries/cooperating-countries/albania\">reports</a> that a small number of beaches are polluted because of inadequate sewage disposal and treatment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Albania, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/albania/\">RAC\u2019s Albania guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to your UK driving licence, you may find it useful to have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> in some situations. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to drive in Albania.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>To import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/united-kingdom/en\">Albanian Embassy</a> in London before you leave. The British Embassy will be unable to help anyone attempting to bring a vehicle into Albania without the correct paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dangers-of-driving-in-albania\">Dangers of driving in Albania</h3>\n\n<p>Driving can be very hazardous. Roads are poor, especially in rural areas. Street lighting in urban areas is subject to power cuts. Elsewhere, even on the major inter-urban arterial routes, there is no street lighting. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked road works, potholes and unlit vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often more practical on rural and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe. Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users. If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you are supposed to wait until the police arrive. This will usually happen quickly in built-up areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h3>\n\n<p>There are some local press reports that jet skis and boats being rented along the coasts may lack adequate safety precautions and equipment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes and tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen.</p>\n\n<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding-and-snow\">Flooding and snow</h3>\n\n<p>From December to February, severe weather may cause flooding, particularly in northern Albania. Heavy snowfall in mountainous areas can lead to disruption to transport and services. Monitor local and international media for the latest information.</p>\n\n",

You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arms-embargo\">Arms embargo</h3>\n\n<p>There is a UK arms embargo against Zimbabwe.

Authorities have in the past used force to suppress them, including after post-election protests in August 2018 and fuel demonstrations in January 2019.\u00a0 Avoid political activity, or activities which could be considered political, including political discussions in public places or online.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to make derogatory or insulting comments about the President or to carry material considered to be offensive to the President\u2019s office.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blackouts-and-water-rationing\">Blackouts and water rationing</h2>\n\n<p>There are long power blackouts because of electricity shortages. During blackouts, traffic lights may not work. There is also water rationing in parts of the country. Contact your tour operator or hotel for the latest updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-network-and-landlines\">Mobile network and landlines</h2>\n\n<p>The Zimbabwean mobile phone network and landlines are unreliable.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>There is a moderate level of crime in Zimbabwe. People travelling alone may be more vulnerable. Mugging, pickpocketing and jewellery theft are common in city centres, especially after dark. Street lighting can be poor. Be vigilant when leaving banks and cash points. Do not carry or display large amounts of cash in public places.</p>\n\n<p>There have been occasional armed robberies targeting foreign residents. Make sure your accommodation is always secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>There have been thefts and smash-and-grab robberies from vehicles, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>at the main intersections along the route to Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport</li>\n  <li>along Liberation Legacy Way (Borrowdale Road) and Churchill Road in Harare</li>\n  <li>on the Masvingo-Beitbridge road</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be particularly vigilant when using these routes. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed. Be careful at night and at petrol stations. Do not leave your vehicle unattended in unguarded areas in towns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry a photocopy of your passport or your Zimbabwean resident ID at all times. Leave your original passport somewhere safe. If you lose your UK passport, get a police report. You may need to show this to immigration to explain why you have no proof of entry when you depart.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Zimbabwean laws on the possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict and carry heavy fines or prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>Zimbabwe\u2019s economic situation remains unpredictable. People use Zimbabwean and US dollars. This may change without notice. It is illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than officially licensed dealers such as banks or bureaux de change. Bureaux de change will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>There is a shortage of physical cash, so it\u2019s not always possible make withdrawals using an international debit or credit card. Change is rarely available, so carry small denomination notes.</p>\n\n<p>Check in advance what payment methods a restaurant, hotel or tour operator will accept. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may not accept credit or debit cards. Most suppliers prefer US dollars in cash.</p>\n\n<p>Check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean or US dollars, as the symbol for both is $. Check exchange rates before any transaction, as they are unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid being overcharged, make sure to say you\u2019re using an international bank card when paying in shops and restaurants. Also, make sure they charge you in the correct currency.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some challenges with international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photographs of government offices, airports, military establishments, official residences, embassies and other sensitive places without special permission from the Ministry of Information. It is also illegal to photograph police and armed forces personnel, demonstrations and protests. Laws are strictly enforced.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"state-house-in-harare\">State House in Harare</h3>\n\n<p>Armed members of the Presidential Guard patrol the area around State House in Harare (the President\u2019s official residence). They do not allow loitering by motorists, cyclists or pedestrians, and it is illegal to take photographs. The roads in this area are closed from 6pm to 6am. Do not use GPS navigation systems around the President\u2019s residence and, if possible, avoid the area altogether.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Since 1984 it has been illegal to hold dual nationality. The Constitutional Court recently ruled that some categories of dual nationality are legal, and it is now possible for Zimbabwean citizens by birth to hold dual nationality. However, the legislation remains inconsistent, and the Zimbabwean authorities may obstruct, detain or even seek to prosecute someone they consider an offender. The British Embassy is not able to provide the full range of consular services to people with dual British and Zimbabwean nationality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pornographic-material\">Pornographic material</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to possess or import pornographic material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"jewellery\">Jewellery</h3>\n\n<p>Do not carry any precious or semi-precious stones without the correct paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Buying or trafficking such goods risks prosecution and prison sentences of up to 9 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"camouflage-clothing\">Camouflage clothing</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal for civilians to wear any form of clothing made from camouflage material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Sex between men and same-sex marriage are illegal in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean society remains conservative towards same-sex relations, especially between men. However, there is a small but active underground LGBT+ scene in Harare and prosecutions are rare. Be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.

Check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.soaz.net/\">Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe</a> whether operators are trained and licensed. Animal attacks have injured and killed visitors. Treat wild animals with caution and respect and always keep a safe distance from them. Some activities, such as walking or canoe safaris, could pose risks to personal safety. Make sure your travel insurance covers all the activities you plan on doing in Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Zimbabwe, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Zimbabwe. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a>\u00a0that offers this service.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Zimbabwe with a UK driving licence for up to 12 months. Make sure you have copies of your passport\u2019s photo page and visa with you in the car at all times. Be ready to show ID if asked and keep the originals in a safe place where you can get them easily.</p>\n\n<p>Obey police signals, stop at roadblocks and tollgates. Make sure you get a receipt if you are asked to pay any fine.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is very poor in Zimbabwe. Traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury. Hazards include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deep potholes</li>\n  <li>broken traffic lights</li>\n  <li>poorly lit vehicles (including heavy good vehicles and cyclists)</li>\n  <li>poorly lit roads</li>\n  <li>badly marked roads</li>\n  <li>stray livestock</li>\n  <li>pedestrians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Emergency services may provide very limited help in the event of an accident, and ambulances are often delayed.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always wear a seatbelt</li>\n  <li>lock car doors</li>\n  <li>avoid driving outside main towns at night</li>\n  <li>travel carefully on roads between cities</li>\n  <li>carry a comprehensive medical kit</li>\n  <li>be careful about stopping at laybys</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plan carefully before setting out on long-distance journeys. Get local advice about any places you plan to visit. Fuel is sometimes unavailable and there may be queues. Carry extra fuel or top up your tank whenever possible. Before you pay for fuel, check if you can pay with an international card.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to continue driving when the President\u2019s motorcade goes past, no matter which side of the road you\u2019re on. If you see the motorcade, pull off the road or on to the side of the road if this is not possible. The security forces have assaulted people for stopping in the wrong place or for not stopping soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re resident in Zimbabwe, you may want to get a Zimbabwean licence to minimise the chance of problems at roadblocks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re bringing a vehicle not registered in Zimbabwe into the country, you must have a police vehicle clearance certificate (temporary import permit).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bus-travel\">Bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Commuter buses (\u2018combis\u2019) are often overcrowded, inadequately maintained, uninsured and recklessly driven. Avoid them if possible. Larger intercity buses may also be poorly driven. There have been serious road accidents involving long-distance buses travelling at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis recommended by hotels are usually reliable and in good condition. Major hotels usually have their own taxis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>) lists all known airlines in Zimbabwe that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to and from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British government employees travelling to and within Zimbabwe have been advised to use carriers that are not on the UK <abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The rail system in Zimbabwe is underdeveloped and very poorly maintained. Level crossings are poorly marked, resulting in many accidents. Passenger services are currently suspended. Check with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nrz.co.zw/\">National Railways of Zimbabwe</a> for updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season runs from November to April.

If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.

The EHIC provides emergency health cover for treatment in Guadeloupe by the French state health service for which you will have to pay but you will be able to claim back up to 70% of the costs on your return to the UK. Visitors travelling (or being air lifted) to Guadeloupe from other non-French islands specifically for medical treatment should be aware that such treatment will not necessarily be covered. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning a permanent move to Guadeloupe, you consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to health care provision under the French national system. \u00a0Enquiries should be made to the DWP Overseas Medical Benefits help-line on 00 44 191 218 1999.

Border guards use passport stamps to check you\u2019re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, a border officer will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<p>You can show evidence (boarding passes and tickets) of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area and ask border guards to add this date and location in your passport.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Portugal, your passport should not be stamped. You should show your proof of residence and passport at border control.

Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (for example to work or study or for business travel), you must meet the Portuguese government\u2019s entry requirements.

Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren\u2019t spiked. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK.

Games of chance, including bingo, are illegal if they\u2019re held on unlicensed premises.</p>\n\n<p>The police may act on reports of illegal gambling in unauthorised premises without warning. Organisers, participants and anyone on the premises may be arrested, charged with a criminal offence and fined or imprisoned.

Waves can be unpredictable and have a strong undertow. Do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>swim at beaches that connect to or from rivers as they can have strong undercurrent</li>\n  <li>swim at beaches without lifeguards</li>\n  <li>dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be aware of rip tides, which can cause drowning. If you are caught in a rip tide, do not try to swim against it. Swim parallel to the coastline until you no longer feel the current, then try to swim towards the shore.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any lifeguard instructions and warning flags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the red flag means danger: do not go into the water</li>\n  <li>the yellow flag means caution: you can walk in the water, but you cannot swim</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More tips can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">ABTA\u2019s swim safe pages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard, particularly in the Algarve. The authorities can fine people who ignore warning signs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"walking-the-levadas-in-madeira\">Walking the levadas in Madeira</h3>\n\n<p>Walking the levadas (ancient irrigation channels) can be challenging. Choose paths that suit your fitness and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared for narrow, uneven paths and heights. Wear suitable clothing and walking boots. Take extra care if it has rained as the ground may be slippery and unstable. Check with your tour guide or local organiser that it is safe before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>Leave details of where you are going with your hotel reception and take a phone with you. Reduce the risk by walking with a group or following a guide.</p>\n\n<p>See more information about walkway closures and access restrictions on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://visitmadeira.com/en/travel-info/useful-information/advice-to-walkers/\">Visit Madeira</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires can occur anywhere in Portugal. Risk of fires is higher when the weather is hot and dry. Fires have become more common due to drought and high temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. The Portuguese authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons.

This also applies if you are staying on a yacht. Be vigilant at all times. Take care when walking alone off the busy main roads and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licensed taxis and take particular care at late night street parties, especially during the festival season.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery.

To drive on the island you must get a local temporary driving licence. The car hire companies will usually assist with this process.

You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of an accident, call the police and don\u2019t move the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis aren\u2019t metered. Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as EC dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport is available and cheaper.

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Protests can occur at short notice, impacting roads and transport. These demonstrations can be confrontational and may turn violent. A number of people have been killed and injured in previous protests. You should remain vigilant, avoid all demonstrations, and monitor local media for the latest information. There is an increased risk of unrest and possible violence around elections.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Despite improvements in security, crime rates remain high in Colombia. Illegal armed groups and other criminal groups are heavily involved in the drugs trade and serious crime including kidnapping (for ransom and political purposes), money laundering and running extortion and prostitution rackets.</p>\n\n<p>Street crime is a problem in major cities, including Bogota, Medellin, Cali and the Caribbean coast. Mugging and pickpocketing can be accompanied by violence. British nationals have been robbed at gun point in the Candelaria area of Bogot\u00e1. Be vigilant, particularly if you are in public places used by foreigners, or near official buildings. Avoid deprived areas of cities. Take care on city streets, especially after dark or if you are on your own. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or wear valuable watches or jewellery. Avoid using your mobile phone in the street.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy has received reports of criminals in Colombia using drugs to subdue their victims. This includes the use of scopolamine, which temporarily incapacitates unsuspecting victims.  Drugs can be administered through food, drinks, cigarettes, aerosols and even paper flyers. Victims become disoriented quickly and are vulnerable to robbery, sexual assault, rape and other crimes. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended and don\u2019t take anything from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, plan how you will travel to and from your destination. Only use pre-booked taxis. Be wary if you are approached by a stranger.</p>\n\n<p>Fake police are known to operate in Bogota and elsewhere to conduct scams, e.g., asking to inspect money to see if it is counterfeit. If approached, you should ask to be escorted to the nearest CAI (\u2018Centro de Atencion Inmediata\u2019 \u2013 local police station).</p>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings - short-term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - also occur. Victims can be targeted or selected at random and held while criminals empty their bank accounts with stolen cash cards. Most cases in major cities involve victims that have been picked up by taxis hailed from the street. There have been incidents where those who have resisted the kidnappers\u2019 demands have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Drugs, organised crime and terrorism are inextricably linked. There\u2019s evidence of high levels of coca cultivation in the following Departments in Colombia: Nari\u00f1o, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1, Meta,Guaviare, the Catatumbo region in the Norte de Santander department, northern Antioquia, and southern Bolivar. There\u2019s a risk to your safety in any area where coca, marijuana or opium poppies are cultivated and near to cocaine processing labs.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are active in all of the departments where coca is cultivated, processed or transported, as well as in many cities. The risk is particularly significant in rural areas near to the borders with Panama, Venezuela and Ecuador; in the Parque Nacional Natural de La Macarena in the Department of Meta; and the port towns of Buenaventura in the Department of Valle de Cauca, Turbo in the Department of Antioquia and Tumaco in the Department of Nari\u00f1o.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>In many rural areas, the authority of the Colombian state is limited, and the British Embassy\u2019s ability to help British nationals in trouble in these areas will also be limited. If you travel to remote areas, travel with recognised tour operators, and make arrangements for your security throughout your visit. You should also seek up-to-date advice from the local authorities before each stage of your journey. Mobile and internet connection in rural areas is often limited.The Pacific coast of Choc\u00f3 is a popular eco-tourist destination. However, much of Choc\u00f3 is remote. Illegal armed groups are active and involved in the drugs trade throughout the department and particularly near the border with Panama. If you intend to travel to the whale-watching towns of Bahia Solano and Nuqui, only do so by air and don\u2019t travel inland or along the coast out of town.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to the \u2018Lost City\u2019 in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, you should only do so as part of an organised tour.</p>\n\n<p>The archaeological park at San Agustin is located in the department of Huila. You should enter and leave the park on the main road through Neiva or Popay\u00e1n.</p>\n\n<p>The tourist site of Ca\u00f1o Cristales is located in the department of Meta, in the Parque Nacional Natural de la Macarena.  If you\u2019re travelling to Ca\u00f1o Cristales, only do so with a reputable tour company, and travel by air to and from the town of La Macarena.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>You should exercise caution when taking public transport in Colombia. Do not hail taxis on the street. There have been reports of express kidnappings, assaults and robberies in unlicensed taxis. Use licensed telephone or internet-based taxi services whenever possible or book through your hotel. Many restaurants in Colombia will book a taxi for you.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eldorado.aero/en/services/means-of-transportation/\">El Dorado International Airport</a> in Bogot\u00e1 only allows authorised taxis to pick up passengers at their terminals. Authorised taxi booths are present in El Dorado and most airports in Colombia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coach-services\">Buses and coach services</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several recent incidents of armed robberies on buses. \nAvoid displaying valuable items like laptops, cameras and mobile phones. Don\u2019t wear jewellery and only carry minimal amounts of cash. Avoid travelling on your own or at night, especially at border crossings or areas where there are few other people around. When travelling to remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or take part in a tour with a reputable company.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Colombia, you can drive with a valid UK driving licence for the duration of your legal stay. If you\u2019re living in Colombia, you will need to apply for a local driving licence. More information is available from the Colombian Ministry of Transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and traffic accidents are common. Avoid driving at night, which can be particularly hazardous. Don\u2019t hitch-hike. The risk of violence and kidnapping is higher in some rural areas, and there is a risk of being caught in roadblocks set up by illegal armed groups. Main roads are generally safe during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The departmental capitals of Amazonas, Vaupes and Guain\u00eda are only accessible by air due to the lack of road infrastructure in these departments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"land-border-crossings\">Land border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> currently advise against all travel to Venezuela\u2019s border regions with Colombia. You should not use any of the Colombia-Venezuelan land crossings</p>\n\n<p>The \u2018Darien Gap\u2019 is a dangerous area renowned for the presence of several illegal armed groups, illegal migration, and drugs trafficking. There\u2019s no road crossing between Colombia and Panama.  Avoid crossing between Panama and Colombia by land.</p>\n\n<p>To cross by land between Colombia and Ecuador, you should only use the crossing on the Pan-American Highway, at Ipiales.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/colombia/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unexploded-ordnance\">Unexploded ordnance</h3>\n\n<p>Colombia is affected by land mines and unexploded ordnance.

Since 1990 Colombia has had a multi-party system. Colombia\u2019s last Presidential elections took place in June 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Colombia suffered from internal armed conflict for over 50 years. On 24 November 2016, Colombia\u2019s President Santos signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla movement to end the internal armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>This peace agreement comes after four years of negotiations. On 1 September 2017, the FARC announced the launch of their new political party, officially ending their status as an armed group.</p>\n\n<p>The Colombian constitution guarantees extensive rights to indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups over their traditional territories and to protect their culture. Indigenous communities have special jurisdiction within their territories within the bounds of the national judicial system.</p>\n\n<p>Political demonstrations can occur in the capital city of Bogota and throughout the country. These can be confrontational and occasionally turn violent. You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations.</p>\n\n",

On 17 January 2019, the ELN conducted a vehicle-bomb attack on a police academy in Bogota, killing 23 people.</p>\n\n<p>The FARC handed its weapons in, as part of Colombia\u2019s 2016 peace deal, on 27 June 2017, marking the end of their status as an armed group. However, dissident groups of the FARC still exist, including one led by prominent ex-commander Ivan Marquez thought to be operating from inside Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>These groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Police and military personnel and installations, are frequently targeted.</p>\n\n<p>The principal intended target of these attacks is not usually foreign tourists. However, the pattern of these attacks means that incidents in public spaces and other areas visited by foreigners can\u2019t be ruled out. Past methods of attack have included car bombs, grenade attacks and explosive devices left in buildings. You should always remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities should an incident occur.</p>\n\n<p>In many areas of Colombia, the security situation can change very quickly. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities and monitor this travel advice. You should be particularly cautious and vigilant during any major events.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

In large cities and state capitals, private clinics provide good quality care for routine treatments and complex treatment. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Not all travel health insurance policies provide cover for private or emergency medical care so check your policy before travelling. Public health facilities and those in smaller cities are generally ill equipped and poorly funded. Ambulance services in remote areas are unreliable and public hospitals often lack adequate medical supplies.</p>\n\n<p>You can find most medication in pharmacies in large cities, but medicine for complex treatment may be unavailable in rural areas and small towns. You may need a prescription from a local doctor to get some controlled medicine.</p>\n\n<p>If you take prescription medication, you will be responsible for determining their legality in Colombia. Always keep your medication in the original container, bring sufficient quantities of your medication with you, pack your medication in your carry-on luggage and carry a copy of your prescriptions.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies in Colombia are known as \u201cdroguer\u00edas\u201d. They can be identified with a cross on the logo and can be easily accessed in the main cities in Colombia, but are less accessible in rural areas. Most pharmacies in Colombia will have a delivery service. You should note that prescriptions must be written in Spanish, in the metric system and using the medicine\u2019s generic name.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, you should dial 123 to ask for assistance (in Spanish). Contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Colombia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page.

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">Read more about what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to move to R\u00e9union, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to health care provision under the French national system.

You must get a transit visa in all other circumstances, including if you are travelling on any regional rail routes.</p>\n\n<p>If you try to transit Belarus in other circumstances without a visa, the border authorities will send you to Minsk to get the appropriate visa.

Keep your entry declaration forms for the duration of your visit. When you leave Belarus, you will complete a new form, but you must also show the entry form.

Belarusian authorities launched a violent crackdown against demonstrators across Belarus after the 2020 presidential elections and is currently a repressive environment.  You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stay vigilant</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds</li>\n  <li>if protests break out, leave the area immediately</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is often a heightened security forces presence on the streets of Minsk and other major cities. Security forces (some may be in plain clothes) might carry out a stop and search or ask for identification documents. Make sure you carry your passport or a photocopy of the photo page of your passport, and visa if you have one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"russian-military-operations\">Russian military operations</h2>\n\n<p>The Belarusian authorities are facilitating Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Russian military operations are taking place inside Belarus. The situation is unpredictable and could escalate without warning. This has increased the risk of conflict within Belarusian borders. If conflict takes place, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s ability to offer consular assistance may be limited. Events in Ukraine are fast-moving.</p>\n\n<p>There is high risk of military activity in places where there are Russian and Belarusian military personnel and equipment, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Yelsk</li>\n  <li>Mazyr</li>\n  <li>Rechitsa</li>\n  <li>Luninets</li>\n  <li>Gomel</li>\n  <li>Asipovichy</li>\n  <li>Baranovichi</li>\n  <li>Brest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid restricted areas reserved for military exercises or operations. Do not take photographs of security forces\u2019 activity (including police and military), and establishments or sites of strategic importance, including government buildings and critical infrastructure. This is illegal. There may not be warning signs in locations where prohibitions are in place.

Customs and immigration can be lengthy and bureaucratic. Ignore any private facilitators who offer to help you pass through checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>You must be able to produce original vehicle ownership documents at border crossings. If you\u2019re not the owner, you will need a letter of \u2018power of attorney\u2019. You must have car insurance. There is more information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/\">insurance requirements on the State Border Committee website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Do not overstay or break the temporary import terms and conditions for your vehicle. If you do, your vehicle could be confiscated at the border or at an in-country police checkpoint.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"polish-border\">Polish border</h2>\n\n<p>The situation close to the Polish border is unpredictable. Border crossings may close or implement restrictions at short notice. You should check this before any travel across the border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lithuania-border\">Lithuania border</h2>\n\n<p>In August 2023, Lithuanian authorities closed two border crossing points with Belarus. Several others remain open. Further border crossings may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Check before you travel across the border, the latest information on the Belarus-Lithuania border can be <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://vrm.lrv.lt/en/\">found on Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior website.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-in-belarus\">Transport risks in Belarus</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Belarus, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/belarus/\">RAC guidance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need car insurance to drive in Belarus.

Stop when instructed and have vehicle documentation available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>The quality of driving in Belarus is unpredictable. A-class highways are in good condition. The condition of B-class roads varies. Some are impassable for periods in winter. Road works and potholes are usually poorly marked.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/belarus/\">RAC</a> guide on driving in Belarus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are no direct flights between Belarus and the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Since mid-2021 all Belarusian airlines have been banned from flying into the UK. The EU has closed its airspace to Belarusian registered aircraft and has sanctioned Belavia the Belarusian state owned carrier.</p>\n\n<p>The UK has sanctioned the Belarusian air traffic control operator.\u00a0 Due to international restrictions on Belavia, they may not have access to components which are needed for the safe maintenance of their aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>HMG staff do not use Belavia.</p>\n\n<p>The UK has placed sanctions on some Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural. It is illegal for any British national or company in the UK to do business with these airlines, including buying airline tickets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are frequent standard security checks at some stations on the Minsk Metro. Transport police may ask to scan your bags. You must comply with this. You could be arrested if you refuse.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pedestrians\">Pedestrians</h3>\n\n<p>You could be fined for jaywalking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"chernobyl-site\">Chernobyl site</h2>\n\n<p>There\u2019s an exclusion zone immediately around the Chernobyl site. This includes the area close to the border with Ukraine in the south east of Belarus. Access to this part of the country is limited. The risk of radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl site is insignificant elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug-related crime. These include prison sentences of up to 5 years for drug possession and up to 25 years for more serious drug-related offences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual relationships are legal in Belarus. However, Belarus is still a conservative society and the LGBT+ scene is very low profile. Very few LGBT+ people are open about their sexuality. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking photographs of all government buildings, military installations and uniformed officials. You will be asked to delete photos and there may be other penalties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-goods-for-charitable-purposes\">Importing goods for charitable purposes</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to import goods or services for charitable purposes, consult the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/\">Embassy of Belarus in the UK</a> for advice about local procedures and tariffs. If you think your goods will be exempt from Belarusian taxation, get written confirmation from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/\">Embassy of Belarus in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Belarus. Because of potential security challenges linked to Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, we advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements in Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national with current surrogacy arrangements in Belarus, contact <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on 01908 516 666 if you have not already done so.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have surrogacy arrangements in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>You may wish to ask your surrogacy agency about the safest location where all parties to the surrogacy arrangement can stay. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot facilitate evacuation.</li>\n  <li>In many cases, Belarusian law requires that the surrogate is married. This could affect British nationality for a child born under such a surrogacy arrangement. You should seek specialist UK legal advice about nationality determinations, Parental Orders and what you need for travel documents.</li>\n  <li>Seek in-country legal advice. This is important for issues like legalising UK documents, notarising Belarusian documents, document processing and the maximum period of stay the authorities will allow. Due to the security challenges, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot confirm which lawyers are currently offering services. The surrogacy process in Belarus can be lengthy and complicated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement in another country, read the guidance for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-guidance-for-intended-parents-pre-surrogacy-pre-birth-and-post-birth/guide-3-for-intended-parents-return-to-the-uk\">intended parents planning for international surrogacy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-foreign-credit-and-debit-cards\">Using foreign credit and debit cards</h3>\n\n<p>There are plenty of ATMs in major cities. However, there are currently problems withdrawing cash using foreign credit and debit cards. Almost all major banks in Belarus do not accept foreign-issued cards. Those banks that do may charge a higher commission.</p>\n\n<p>There is also limited cash available. Many ATMs have limits on the amount of cash you can withdraw, particularly for foreign cards. Not all cards will be accepted in Belarus. Many reputable international money transfer providers have suspended operations in Belarus. Consider having cash in US dollars or euros if you decide to visit Belarus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sanctions\">Sanctions</h3>\n\n<p>The UK government has imposed sanctions against a range of Belarusian companies and individuals. These may impact on financial transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"exchanging-currency\">Exchanging currency</h3>\n\n<p>It can be difficult to exchange British pounds for Belarusian roubles. US dollars and Euros are more widely accepted. You may be asked to present your passport at a foreign currency exchange. Use government-licensed booths to exchange currency. You can find these in or near major stores, hotels and banks. If you exchange money elsewhere, you could be fined or arrested and the currency will be confiscated. You cannot exchange Belarusian roubles into other currencies outside Belarus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bank-services\">Bank services</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to Belarus, speak to your UK bank before you go. Because of sanctions against Belarus, your bank may block your card if you use it in Belarus. Many banks have suspended their services in Belarus, so please check with your provider.</p>\n\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina\">Terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Previous attacks have included firearms attacks on government, law enforcement interests and the public. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public protests occur from time to time and can cause traffic disruption. Protests are normally peaceful. Keep up to date with developments through the media, be vigilant and avoid all protests.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk of violent incidents linked to locally controversial issues, usually from the conflict of the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in anti-UK rhetoric from some politicians in the Republika Srpska (one of the entities that makes up the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina). This could translate into wider anti-UK sentiment. You should avoid political demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>You can report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a written report. Local police do not always have English language skills and you may need the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bosnia-and-herzegovina-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/bosnia-and-herzegovina-translators-and-interpreters\">services of a translator</a> .</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of pickpockets on public transport and in the tourist and pedestrian areas of Sarajevo and other cities. Make sure personal belongings, including your passport, are secure. Obvious displays of wealth, including large quantities of cash or jewellery and luxury vehicles can make you a target for opportunist thieves.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in thefts from cars in popular tourist areas in and around Sarajevo, particularly on Mount Trebevic. Make sure your vehicle is locked and your belongings are out of sight. Take particular care in areas popular with foreign tourists and in crowded public venues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"old-landmines-and-unexploded-weapons\">Old landmines and unexploded weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons remain from the 1992 to 1995 war. Whilst highly populated areas and major routes are largely clear, risks remain in less populated and rural areas.  Do not stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide.  Take care near:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the former lines of conflict</li>\n  <li>the edge of roads</li>\n  <li>the open countryside</li>\n  <li>destroyed or abandoned buildings (including in towns)</li>\n  <li>neglected land</li>\n  <li>untarred roads</li>\n  <li>woods and orchards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For further information, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhmac.org/?lang=en\">Mine Action Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"english-language\">English language</h3>\n\n<p>English is not always widely spoken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport or official photo ID with you at all times. You must be able to show some form of identification if required, including when checking into hotels. For more information, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://msb.gov.ba/inf_za_strance/default.aspx?id=3068&amp;langTag=en-US\">Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The dates vary by year and country.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from other guests</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There are no laws against same-sex relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but LGBT+ communities continue to report incidents of discrimination and even violence. Showing affection in public is likely to be frowned upon and may receive unwelcome attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Check that your travel and medical insurance cover you for any adventure activities and sports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving\">Diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving off Mostar bridge is dangerous and has resulted in serious injuries and fatalities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rafting\">Rafting</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bosnia-herzegovina/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling outside the main towns and cities, especially in winter when road conditions can worsen quickly.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in an accident, stay at the scene and do not move your vehicle until the police arrive. Traffic police can impose on-the-spot fines for any traffic offence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>For visits of up to 6 months, you need\u00a0either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> or a valid UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, you will need to get a local driving licence. Bosnian authorities will keep your UK licence (or any other foreign licence)  when applying for a Bosnian one. You cannot exchange an international driving permit for a Bosnian licence.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhembassy.co.uk/pocetna-eng/\">Contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in London</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to the country. The British Embassy will not be able to help if you do not have the correct documentation when you arrive at the border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-insurance\">Border insurance</h3>\n\n<p>Border insurance is required for all vehicles crossing into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not always possible to buy border insurance at all border crossings. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://granpol.gov.ba/\">Border Police</a> advise travellers to use the recently upgraded   crossings at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bijaca</li>\n  <li>Crveni Grm (south)</li>\n  <li>Izacici (west)</li>\n  <li>Kamensko</li>\n  <li>Karakaj and Raca (east)</li>\n  <li>Samac (north-east)</li>\n  <li>Zubci (south-east)</li>\n  <li>Doljani</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"winter-equipment-requirements\">Winter equipment requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Between November and April you are legally required to use winter equipment on your vehicle. This means:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>all tyres must have an MS, M+S or M&amp;S mark and a stylised symbol of a snowflake \u2013 the tread should be at least 4 millimetres deep</li>\n  <li>snow chains should be carried as their use is compulsory in winter conditions\u00a0if the sign is displayed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Official taxis in Sarajevo and the major towns are well-regulated and metered. Taxi drivers from the Republika Srpska might refuse to drive to a destination in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the same from the Federation to the Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p>Do not use unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Sarajevo (Butmir) International airport is prone to fog, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled during the winter months, particularly in December and January. Many airlines will not take responsibility for accommodation due to delays caused by adverse weather. If you are travelling into or out of Sarajevo during winter, make sure you have enough money if you are forced to extend your stay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires are common in Herzegovina (the southern part of the country) during summer heat waves, mostly happening in inaccessible areas. Fires are normally kept under control, but if they get close to populated areas, road closures are possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Flash floods and landslides remain a risk in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina after heavy rain. Follow the instructions and guidance provided by local officials and traffic police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes and small tremors are recorded throughout the year, usually without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.</p>\n\n",
