                        "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Street crime like bag snatching and pick-pocketing occurs in Montevideo. Muggings and robberies (sometimes armed) also take place. Keep valuables, spare cash and spare credit cards in a safe. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and where possible use machines that are not on the street (e.g. shopping centres or banks). Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewellery. Consider carrying cash and bankcards in separate pockets and only take with you the money you need at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Cars left on the streets at night in Montevideo are regularly broken into. Try to park in a paid car park or a well-lit and busy area. Always remember to lock your car and avoid leaving valuables, luggage, personal documents and cash in the vehicle. Don\u2019t drive with bags or other valuables visible inside your vehicle, especially not on the front seat.  There have been instances of windows being smashed and valuables grabbed when waiting at traffic lights and junctions.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking downtown or in the port area alone.</p>\n\n<p>While crime rates are generally lower in other parts of Uruguay, you should remain alert and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to report a crime, you must go to the nearest police station. You can also start to file a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://denuncia.minterior.gub.uy/en\">police report online</a> in English or Spanish. You must then sign it off at a police station within 48 hours of submitting it online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The main bus terminal for long distance journeys is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.trescruces.com.uy\">Tres Cruces</a>.

You should take out full insurance.</p>\n\n<p>You must wear a seatbelt by law in the front and back seats and have a first aid kit in your car. Children under the age of 12 must also wear a seatbelt and be seated in a child or booster seat.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a zero tolerance limit for driving under the influence of alcohol. Transport Police often breathalyse drivers.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and traffic is disorganised. Drivers often change lane and make unexpected turns without indicating and use hazard lights to stop in the middle of a lane to run an errand or pick/drop someone off rather than park. Motorbikes often go the wrong way down one way streets so always look both ways when crossing junctions. Stop signs, traffic lights and speed limits are sometimes ignored. You must use dipped headlights during the day. Take extra care when driving at night.</p>\n\n<p>The main toll roads from Colonia del Sacramento to Montevideo and Punta del Este are in good condition and well-marked. However, serious road traffic accidents are common. Poor road layout and excess speed are frequent causes. Uruguay is starting to introduce electronic-tag-only tolls where you will need to prepay or link your credit card to an electronic sticker fixed to the front windscreen. For more information see: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telepeaje.com.uy\">www.telepeaje.com.uy</a> (in Spanish). Rental cars will already have the electronic tags and you will be charged for any tolls via the rental company.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of roads in the rest of Uruguay varies. Some roads may suddenly deteriorate, with potholes and uneven road surfaces requiring extra care, especially in bad weather.</p>\n\n<p>More information about transport regulations (in Spanish only) can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/transito-y-transporte/transito\">Montevideo municipality website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>The main airport is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aeropuertodecarrasco.com.uy\">Carrasco International Airport</a>\u00a0on the outskirts of Montevideo.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

Take care when swimming in the rivers and the Atlantic Ocean taking into account currents, rocks and sand banks that have sudden descents. Beaches with lifeguards display red, amber and green flags depending on the weather conditions and a red flag with green cross when they detect conditions that present potential health risks to the population.

The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has published guidance on nationality in China.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Prescriptions issued by UK doctors are not valid in Macao. To obtain prescription medication, you will need to see a local doctor. For further information, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/macao-list-of-medical-facilities/macao-list-of-medical-facilities\">list of medical facilities in Macao</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>Dengue fever is common in Macao.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Off-piste skiing is very dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. Follow safety instructions and warnings. Consider carrying search equipment.  Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used, are the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter.

Traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorways\">Motorways</h3>\n\n<p>You must buy and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways or face large fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ch.ch/en/swiss-motorway-sticker/\">buy a vignette online</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-conditions\">Road conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Roads outside urban areas are narrow and winding. Road conditions can deteriorate fast (even in summer) especially during heavy rainfall and snowfall at higher altitudes.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"political-protests\">Political protests</h2>\n\n<p>Political protests in Peru can lead to road blockades, suspension of train services, disruption in immigration services of land borders and airport closures - often without prior notice or estimated reopening timelines. Protests can be unpredictable, can include violence, and can spread and escalate quickly. Clashes between protestors and the security forces have resulted in casualties in the past, which included significant violent civil unrest in the Puno and Apurimac regions in December 2022 and January 2023.  Local police and emergency services do not have the same capacity to respond to traveller emergencies in these regions as elsewhere in Peru.</p>\n\n<p>Where protests or criminal activity result in travel disruption or damage to infrastructure, the British Government\u2019s ability to provide consular support will be limited, as may that of local authorities, especially if infrastructure such as airports, roads and railroads are affected.</p>\n\n<p>In Lima protests often have a focus in the historic centre, where access can be restricted, but can also spread to other areas. Other regions that have seen recent protests include Cusco, Arequipa and Puno.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals in Peru cannot participate in political activities by law, including in demonstrations against the government.</p>\n\n<p>You should be especially vigilant and take particular care to avoid all areas of large gatherings, demonstrations and protests. If possible, you should remain in a safe place, follow the authorities\u2019 advice, and monitor local media, including social media channels. Be wary of unverified, unofficial information.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers arriving in Peru should be aware that travel to some parts of the country or the return to Lima could be affected by protests and should be prepared for delays or disruption. You should ensure you travel with a sufficient supply of food, water, cash in local currency and personal medication, and allow extra time to reach your destination. You should liaise with your local airline, hotel or tour operator for further advice and assistance that they may provide to mitigate disruption, and for information on alternate arrangements that may need to be made for onward travel, including bus and rail journeys.</p>\n\n<p>Due to protests, the following States of Emergency are in place, which amongst other things allow the military forces to assist the local police and authorities in maintaining law and order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>a 30-day extension to the State of Emergency in Pataz province in La Libertad region starting on 17 October 2023</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>a 60-day extension to the State of Emergency on the Southern Apurimac-Cusco-Arequipa road corridor starting on 12 October 2023</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information on states of emergency, please see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas\">El Peruano official newspaper</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airports\">Airports</h3>\n\n<p>Protests may lead to airports suspending operations. For information on airport operations, please visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lima-airport.com/\">Lima airport website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"train-services\">Train services</h3>\n\n<p>Some train services in the South, including trains to or from Machu Picchu, are occasionally temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure, or disrupted, due to protests. Visitors should check with travel providers in advance of travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-protests\">General Protests</h3>\n\n<p>In general, local protests are common, can start with very little notice, and can turn violent quickly, potentially causing lengthy disruption to travel and services. Protests can disrupt road, rail, river and air travel and affect tourist areas like Lima, Ica, Cusco, Arequipa, Puno, Puerto Maldonado and Iquitos. Protests in Puno can result in the closure of the border crossing with Bolivia, including Lake Titicaca. Protests in Machu Picchu can result in the suspension of train and bus services. Protests in the centre of Lima can disrupt access to the historical centre and to some public offices. Protests in Ica can result in the blockade of Panamericana highway. Protestors may also block rivers essential for transportation in some remote regions, including the Manu region of Madre de Dios and in the region of Iquitos. Protests in the Amazon area can result in the disruption of tour vessels in remote areas where access to food and water can be limited and evacuations are only possible by boat. This may result in the temporary detainment of tourists.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"social-conflicts\">Social conflicts</h2>\n<p>Local groups often announce strike action with little or no notice. These are normally around mining interests and may quickly spill over from one region to another. These demonstrations can become violent and may lead to roadblocks. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>On 19 September 2023 a 60-day state of emergency for security reasons was declared in San Martin de Porres and San Juan de Lurigancho districts in Lima region, and in the districts of Sullana, Bellavista, Marcavelica, Salitral, Querecotillo, Ignacio Escudero and Miguel Checa in Sullana province, Piura region.</p>\n\n<p>On 9 October 2023 a 60-day state of emergency for security reasons was declared in Cercado de Lima (which includes Lima historical centre) and Lince districts in Lima region.</p>\n\n<p>The states of emergency reflect a government focus on ensuring security and you should ensure you follow relevant instructions from the authorities. For more information please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas\">El Peruano newspaper</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>Street crime, including muggings and thefts, is a significant problem in Lima, Cusco, Arequipa and other major cities. Be vigilant in public places and when withdrawing cash from ATMs. Avoid walking alone in quiet areas or at night.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of thefts at gunpoint affecting foreign nationals, including British tourists and residents. These have happened in tourist areas of Miraflores and Barranco, including outside hotels popular with tourists, during the day and at night. In early 2019 there were a small number of robberies in and around luxury lodges near Puerto Maldonado city in the Madre de Dios region, including on tour buses. Some of these have been at gunpoint and involved British tourists. As with travel across the country, you should remain aware of your surroundings and avoid wearing or displaying expensive items. In the event of a robbery, do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk. Report the matter to local police as soon as possible. If the incident takes place in a lodge or hotel, staff will be able to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Passport theft is also common on inter-city buses and at bus stations. Keep your passport with you at all times during your bus journey and take particular care of valuables if you travel on a bus at night. Provincial and inter-city buses are sometimes held up and the passengers robbed.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is common, and occurs even in crowded, public areas. Pickpockets and bag snatchers may work in pairs or groups and employ a variety of ruses to divert their victim\u2019s attention.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Avoid wearing expensive watches and jewellery, or showing signs of affluence.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that your belongings are secure at all times.</li>\n  <li>Never leave bags unattended.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tourists have been targeted and robbed by bogus taxi drivers. Do not hail a taxi on the street. Use licensed telephone or app-based taxi services whenever possible, or ask your hotel to book one for you. Be particularly careful when arriving at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima and at bus terminals. Bogus taxi drivers and thieves pretending to be tour operators sometimes approach arriving passengers. At the airport, use one of the official taxi companies located at desks directly outside the arrival hall.   Further details are on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lima-airport.com/eng/for-passengers/transportation-from-to-the-airport/licensed-taxis\">Lima Airport Partners website</a>. At bus terminals, use one of the taxis registered with them.  Cars travelling from Lima city to the airport have been targeted by thieves when diverted off the main route by GPS navigation applications.</p>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings involving tourists have occurred. Victims are usually abducted for a few hours and forced to withdraw money from ATMs for their release. Most express kidnappings take place at night, but incidents also occur during daylight hours. Incidents often involve criminals posing as taxi drivers, or taxi drivers working for organised gangs. Do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk. Report the matter to local police as soon as possible. Fake kidnappings occur throughout the country. Criminals use stolen cell-phones to contact family members claiming to have kidnapped the owner of the phone and then ask for ransom money.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of cases of rape, mostly in the Cusco and Arequipa areas. Be alert to the use of \u2018date rape\u2019 and other drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times. If you\u2019re in a bar and don\u2019t feel well, try to seek help from people you know. Unscrupulous tour agents have targeted lone young female travellers in the Cusco area.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a victim of crime, try to report it to the police as soon as possible so they can start investigations.</p>\n\n<p>The army has been called in to support the police tackle crime in Lima and Callao. You should follow instructions given to you by military, police or other officials.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/en/\">website of the Peruvian Ministry of Tourism</a> has useful information for tourists and visitors in English, and its local tourist Information and Assistance service - telephone +51 1 574 8000 (24 hours a day) can handle enquiries in English. On <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">the Ministry of Tourism website</a> you will also find information about the government offices that help tourists around the country. The Tourist Protection Network has launched a new 24/7 free line to contact the Tourist Police on 0800 22221. They can handle enquiries in English.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drug-trafficking\">Drug trafficking</h2>\n\n<p>Drugs, organised crime and terrorism are inextricably linked. There is a higher risk to your safety in regions where there is intensive coca cultivation and processing, including the border areas with Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil and the Valley of Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM). Remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group in the VRAEM continue to conduct occasional ambushes and attacks mainly targeting the police, military forces and local authorities. Seek local advice about dangerous areas and be alert to possible threats. Take official warnings seriously, follow the advice of local authorities, and report any suspicious activity or items to the police. If there\u2019s an attack, leave the area as soon as it\u2019s safe. Avoid areas affected in case of secondary attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Where there are greater security concerns or local authorities currently have limited presence, including in the VRAEM and the border areas with Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, the British Government will have limited ability to offer assistance, and may not have the ability to provide emergency or consular support. While we will liaise with local authorities to request assistance, their ability to respond may also be very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal drug use and drugs trafficking in Peru is subject to severe punishment, with lengthy jail sentences.  Prison conditions in Peru are extremely poor and the Embassy cannot intervene in police or judicial matters, nor is it able to secure more favourable conditions for those in detention.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency for security reasons is in force in some districts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junin, Madre de Dios and Cusco regions (Cusco city, Machu Picchu and Manu Park are not affected). A 60-day extension to the State of Emergency in Putumayo and Mariscal Ramon Castilla provinces in Loreto region has been declared starting on 16 October 2023. For further information you should contact\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Iperu</a>. If you do decide to visit any area under a state of emergency you should follow instructions given to you by military, police or other officials.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unregulated-tour-services\">Unregulated tour services</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy/zipline, bungee jumping, paragliding, kayaking, rock climbing, sand buggies, surfing etc,  the agency providing the service must have a licence for these activities. For more information, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Ministry of Tourism</a>, as they can provide you with updated information on tour and sport services. You should also check with companies for their health and safety precautions.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of unregulated surfboard rentals at the beaches of Miraflores, that do not operate with the Municipality permission. To our knowledge, there is no life-guard provision.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h2>\n\n<p>Be especially alert to the local security situation in the border areas with Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil, where there is a higher risk to your safety due to intensive coca cultivation and processing. There are reports of increased drug trafficking and other organised crime in the area around the Putumayo river. Seek local advice about dangerous areas and be alert to possible threats. Take official warnings seriously, follow the advice of local authorities, and report any suspicious activity or items to the police. If there\u2019s an attack, leave the area as soon as it\u2019s safe. Avoid areas affected in case of secondary attacks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing the Peru-Ecuador border (by land) you should do so at official checkpoints only. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines, and some tourists have been targeted and robbed by fake taxi drivers. You should exercise extra vigilance in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inca-trail\">Inca trail</h2>\n\n<p>To protect the Inca trail, where only guided groups are allowed, there is a government fee and restrictions on numbers. During the high season (June\u2013August) you should make reservations with a travel agency well in advance. Always register when entering national parks and be particularly careful in steep or slippery areas which are unfenced or unmarked. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. Only very basic medical assistance is available at Machu Picchu.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative route to Machu Picchu, also known as \u2018the Inca Jungle Trail\u2019 can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions and fatal road accidents have been reported.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lake-titicaca\">Lake Titicaca</h2>\n\n<p>Travel in groups when walking along the banks of Lake Titicaca. There have been incidents of armed robberies against travellers walking on their own.\u00a0Take care at all times and contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones. Local authorities advise against travelling alone at night in the Desaguadero area on the Peru-Bolivia border at the southern end of Lake Titicaca.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"nazca-lines\">Nazca Lines</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to overfly the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book. There have been several fatal accidents in recent years.  For more information, please contact <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">Iperu</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"spiritual-cleansing\">Spiritual cleansing</h2>\n\n<p>Shamans and other individuals offer \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019 to tourists in the Amazon area, Northern Peru and Cusco. This service is often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro and typically involves the consumption of a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an hallucinogenic drug which is prohibited in the UK as a Class A substance. Consumption of this brew is not regulated and its interaction with existing medical conditions isn\u2019t well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after participating in these ceremonies. There have also been reports of sexual assault during these ceremonies.  If you have been sexually assaulted or raped in Peru and you wish to seek assistance or to report the incident, you can refer to this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/682686/Rape_and_Sexual_Assault_Victims_Guide.pdf\">guidance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Spiritual cleansing retreats are usually some distance from populated areas making it difficult to access medical attention for those who need it. Some retreats have basic medical services, including first aid, but others don\u2019t. Some don\u2019t even have an established plan for how clients can access medical facilities in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"amazon-region\">Amazon region</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"solo-travellers\">Solo travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Criminal activity has been reported along the Amazon river near the tri-border area with Brazil and Colombia. Thieves can be armed and are known locally as \u2018river pirates\u2019. Independent travellers have been targeted, with foreign nationals having been involved in recent incidents. Be especially alert to the local security situation in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"luxury-cruise-ships\">Luxury Cruise ships</h2>\n\n<p>Passengers\u2019 security arrangements vary between different cruise operators in the Amazon region. For more information about safety and security on  cruise ships, contact your cruise ship operator or\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx\">iPeru (official tourist information and assistance)</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"huaraz-region-of-the-cordillera-blanca-mountains\">Huaraz Region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains</h2>\n\n<p>Several hikers have died and others have had to be rescued after serious accidents in the Huaraz region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains, where Peru\u2019s highest peaks are located. Most rescues are carried out on foot because helicopters can\u2019t fly to the areas where hikers are experiencing transport difficulties. Contact iperu offices in Huaraz (telephone: +51 (43) 428812) before you set off.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"river-rafting-and-boating\">River rafting and boating</h2>\n\n<p>Check that the company you use is well established and make sure your insurance covers you for all the activities you want to undertake. The weather can impact on white-water rafting and boating conditions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sand-buggies\">Sand buggies\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There have been deaths and injuries involving recreational sand buggies, particularly in the sand dunes around Ica and Lake Huacachina. These buggies are unregulated and the drivers and agencies take no responsibility for the welfare of passengers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Peru with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months or with an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your passport or a valid ID (\u2018carne de extranjer\u00eda\u2019 if you are a resident) with you at all times when driving.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care if you are driving close to places where protests are taking place. Don\u2019t attempt to pass blockades.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards in Peru are poor. Stop signs and traffic lights are often ignored. Fatal crashes occur frequently. Drivers don\u2019t always show concern for pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Bus crashes are common, especially at night. Only use reputable transport companies, and where possible avoid overnight travel, especially in mountainous and remote regions. Always wear a seat belt.</p>\n",

You\u2019re strongly advised to ignore this type of e-mail or online request.</p>\n\n<p>Sex with a child (in Peru this means under 14 years old) is illegal. Offenders will face long term jail sentences.</p>\n\n<p>You are not allowed to take any archaeological artefacts from the country without the proper authorisation.</p>\n\n<p>In Peru you will likely find products made using wild plants and animals. The vast majority of these animals and products are of illegal origin and could involve protected or endangered species. Their commercialization and export are also illegal or may require special permits when leaving Peru.</p>\n\n<p>The following common products, which are often found for sale in Peru, could be illegal. We recommend avoiding them. At the very least, you should ask about their origins before buying or consuming them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Products made from the skin of felines, deer, bears, snakes, and other animals</li>\n  <li>Crafts made with preserved invertebrates (butterflies, spiders, beetles, starfish, etc) and vertebrates (sea horses and fish)</li>\n  <li>Crafts and jewelry made with wild bird feathers (including condor feathers), turtle shells, teeth, bones, and other animal parts</li>\n  <li>Live monkeys and birds, such as finger monkeys, parakeets, and macaws</li>\n  <li>Dishes made with caiman, paca (wild rodent) or turtle meat, and beverages made with frog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information, go to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sicompraserescomplice.pe/\">Campaign Against Illegal Wildlife Trafficking</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>The sale of souvenirs made with any animal parts, including condor feathers, is illegal. These feathers are often sold in tourist markets in Cusco.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry identification with you at all times. You can carry a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place.  You may be asked to show your passport to enter some archaeological sites.  You should check with your tour operator in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is legal in Peru but social attitudes are generally conservative. Crimes against the LGBT community are not included in recently adopted hate crime legislation and same-sex partnerships are not formally recognised. Public displays of affection between same-sex couples are likely to be frowned upon. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid taking photographs of anything of a military nature.</p>\n",

If the case is considered low by the hospital, the passenger can spend their 21-day quarantine in their accommodation. The passenger will need to cover all costs. There are no known protocols for mpox at land borders in Peru. Please note that this can change at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Following a countrywide floods in Peru, the country is experiencing a major dengue outbreak. On 25 May 2023 the Peruvian authorities declared a 120-day national health emergency in 222 districts following an outbreak of dengue fever.

If you\u2019re unsure how Peru\u2019s entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>Normally, you don\u2019t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism/visit. If you\u2019re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consulado.pe/es/londres/Paginas/Inicio.aspx\">Peruvian Consulate-General</a> in London. For information see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/peru/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that previous requirements relating to Covid-19 vaccinations for entry in Peru were removed on 26 October 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Some airlines and bus companies are not allowing foreign visitors, whose passports have been lost/stolen, to travel internally carrying a Police report only. They require a new passport or more documents. If your passport has been lost/stolen and you plan to travel internally, please contact your travel agency/airline/bus company first to check on requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"immigration\">Immigration</h3>\n\n<p>Clashes between the police and migrants were reported on the border between Peru and Chile in April and early May 2023. This led to delays in processing at this border crossing. As a result, on 25 September 2023 a state of emergency was extended for 60 days on all border areas of Peru, covering different districts and provinces in the regions of Tumbes, Piura, Cajamarca, Amazonas, Loreto, Madre de Dios and Tacna.\u00a0States of Emergency, amongst other things, allow the military to assist the local police and authorities in maintaining law and order.\u00a0For full details, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://busquedas.elperuano.pe/normaslegales/decreto-supremo-que-declara-el-estado-de-emergencia-en-la-pr-decreto-supremo-n-055-2023-pcm-2172936-2/\">El Peruano newspaper</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entry-stamps\">Entry stamps</h2>\n\n<p>Passports do not get an immigration entry or exit stamp in any international airport in Peru. The entry into and exit from the country is registered digitally only. You can find the registration of your immigration control and the number of days granted to stay legally in Peru in this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cel.migraciones.gob.pe/ConsultaTAMVirtual/VerificarTAM\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Peru  overland from Bolivia, either by walking, by bus or taxi, you must make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office. You need to go to the immigration checkpoint proactively, as they may not reach out to you.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, you must make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Peru without an immigration entry stamp through any land border, you may still be able to enter Peru with no problems, but once in, you will not be able to leave Peru until you have obtained a new entry stamp. That is required by law.</p>\n\n<p>In order to obtain a new entry stamp the immigration authorities will need you to complete a form (fully in Spanish) and provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, e.g. air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. This process is fully online and has very specific guidelines to follow.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won\u2019t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and these orders may prevent you from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years.  The British Embassy cannot intervene in immigration decisions.</p>\n\n<p>If your passport was not stamped on entry into Peru through a land border, we can assist you in requesting a new entry stamp or the exit order. The sooner you start that process, the better.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-your-passport-and-travel-documents-before-you-travel\">Check your passport and travel documents before you travel</h2>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-validity\">Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting Peru, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Some airlines have been allowing non-resident passengers to travel to Peru without the six-month passport validity requirement. These passengers have not been allowed to enter Peru upon arrival.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>Normally, you don\u2019t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism/visit. If you\u2019re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consulado.pe/es/londres/Paginas/Inicio.aspx\">Peruvian Consulate-General</a> in London.</p>\n\n<p>If you have tourism status in Peru, you\u2019ll need to apply online for a special permit in order to sign any type of contract, eg, purchase of a home, business contracts, at a notary public. For more information, please contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.migraciones.gob.pe/index.php/permiso-especial-para-firmar-contratos-pefc/\">Peruvian Immigration Office</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consulado.pe/es/londres/Paginas/Inicio.aspx\">Peruvian Consulate-General</a> in London.</p>\n\n<p>On arrival, you\u2019re normally given permission to stay for up to 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>Double check the period of time you\u2019ve been granted. If you overstay, you\u2019ll need to pay a fine. In the worst case scenario you could be held in detention.</p>\n\n<p>While it is not required by the immigration authorities, some airlines require passengers to show proof of onward travel (e.g. an airline ticket) in order to travel to Peru.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children\">Travelling with children</h3>\n\n<p>Children under the age of 18 years travelling on a British passport who have resident status in Peru need written permission (Autorizaci\u00f3n de Viaje Notarial) from the non accompanying parent(s) to leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>This permission is obtained by a notary public in Peru. The letter must mention the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date.</p>\n\n<p>If unable to obtain a notarial permission, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorizaci\u00f3n de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge. If one of the parents has committed certain crimes, the other parent can request a judicial written permission from the judge. If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a notary public, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued.</p>\n\n<p>Children who have tourist status do not need these permissions, but immigration officers are free to request them in circumstances considered suspicious by the immigration authorities or if the child has stayed in Peru for over 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.consulado.pe/es/londres/Paginas/Inicio.aspx\">Peruvian Consulate</a> in London or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.migraciones.gob.pe/\">Peruvian Immigration Department</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs\">Customs</h3>\n\n<p>You can enter Peru with one laptop and two mobiles phones maximum per passenger without paying taxes. You should familiarise yourself with Peruvian immigration or customs procedures before you enter the country.\u00a0For further details\u00a0contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.conperlondres.com/\">Peruvian Consulate</a> in London.</p>\n\n<p>If you are returning to the UK via Europe, be aware that the customs authorities in European airports frequently confiscate duty free alcohol and other liquids purchased at the duty free shops in Lima airport from passengers in transit.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

These normally include Cusco, the routes to Machu Picchu (including the alternative Santa Maria-Santa Teresa-hydroelectric plant route, and the Salkantay route), the route to Manu (in Cusco and Madre de Dios) and the north of Peru. Weather conditions can also lead to the delay of flights, including in Cusco and Arequipa.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling in these areas during the rainy season and check the latest conditions with your tour operator. You should ensure you travel with a sufficient supply of food, water, cash in local currency, personal medication,\u00a0and warm clothes should travel be disrupted.

If in a building when an earthquake strikes keep away from the windows and make your way to the safe zones marked in most buildings with an \u2018S\u2019 sign. If you are outside keep away from buildings and other areas where objects, like trees or power lines, could fall.</p>\n\n<p>Where natural disasters result in disruption to travel and/or communications, the British Government\u2019s ability to support will be limited. While we will liaise with local authorities, their ability to respond may also be very limited if circumstances are unfavourable, including if infrastructure such as airports, roads and railroads are affected.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanoes\">Volcanoes</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to visit areas of known volcanic activity, pay careful attention to all warnings and follow the advice of the local authorities.

Stay away from political rallies and crowds. Public transport is often disrupted because of blocked roads and security incidents, which can lead to fuel and food shortages.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to or stay in Haiti against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, check local media and make sure you have contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, tell family and friends about your travel plans and carefully consider your movements\u00a0in advance, taking the safest routes available.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation is unpredictable and crime levels are high. There is usually an increase in crime leading up to the:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>holiday season in December</li>\n  <li>Carnival (in February or March)</li>\n  <li>beginning of the school year (late August/early September)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-and-gang-activity\">Criminal and gang activity</h3>\n\n<p>Theft, including armed robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing, is common in Haiti. Criminal and gang activity is especially common in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bel Air</li>\n  <li>Carrefour</li>\n  <li>Cit\u00e9 Soleil</li>\n  <li>downtown Port-au-Prince</li>\n  <li>Martissant</li>\n  <li>Petion-Ville</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People using cash machines have been targeted by criminals. Gangs, often on motorbikes, target people making withdrawals or leaving banks, particularly those travelling on foot. Take care when withdrawing money at public ATMs and use supermarkets or hotels with security guards. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Armed robbery is common. Victims are often attacked in the daytime by armed thieves on motorcycles. Some attacks have resulted in fatalities. Single women drivers in traffic have been targeted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnappings\">Criminal kidnappings</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of criminal kidnaps in Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal groups may target whole communities or individuals, including children. Missionary and humanitarian aid workers are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Most victims have been released after the payment of a ransom. In some exceptional cases, however, victims have disappeared or been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the threat of kidnap and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting. Be vigilant across the country, remaining alert to small groups, especially near where you\u2019re staying.</p>\n\n<p>Keep doors and windows secure at all times and be wary of inviting anyone into your residence who you do not know or were not expecting. Security guards are recommended at residential properties.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"haiti-dominican-republic-border\">Haiti-Dominican Republic border</h2>\n\n<p>The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is closed, however the Dominican government announced the reopening of air travel between Haiti and the Dominican Republic on 30 October. The status of the border remains subject\u00a0to change at short notice. Monitor local media for updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy legal proceedings, jail sentences and fines.</p>\n\n<p>Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry items through customs for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re caught in possession of drugs or suspected of drug trafficking, you may be arrested and jailed for weeks or months before appearing in court. Prison conditions in Haiti are very poor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You should always carry proof of your identity. Keep a copy of the photo page of your passport and visa stamp separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Local attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. In Haiti, same-sex sexual activity is legal. However, the attitude of many Haitians to the LGBT+ community is hostile.</p>\n\n<p>LGBT+ travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted and negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>It is uncommon for opposite or same-sex couples to show affection in public.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous. Armed carjacking is common and criminal groups often use improvised road blocks to extort or kidnap motorists.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Haiti for up to 90 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After 90 days you\u2019ll need an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Basic services such as transport and communications are likely to be severely disrupted if a major disaster happens.</p>\n\n<p>Flash floods and landslides happen regularly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. During this period, tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes. Monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a> and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>\u00a0for information about how to prepare, and what to do if there is a warning of a hurricane.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in Haiti. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of tsunamis if a major earthquake happens close to shore, follow the instructions of the local authorities.</p>\n\n",

Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you\u2019ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.evisa.gov.kh/\">Apply for an e-visa</a> at least 4 days in advance.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not get an e-visa, you can get a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.evisa.gov.kh/\">visa on arrival</a> at airports or land border crossings.

There is no limit to this fine. If you overstay more than 30 days, you will need to leave Cambodia and pay the fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"work-permits\">Work permits</h3>\n\n<p>To work in Cambodia, you need a business visa and a work permit. Business visas are issued by the immigration department and are available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on arrival in Phnom Penh airport</li>\n  <li>at the immigration department</li>\n  <li>in advance from a Cambodian embassy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.</p>\n\n<p>The Cambodian government strictly enforces these rules, so you should ask the relevant department for the latest advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/39/cambodia\">TravelHealthPro\u2019s Cambodia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>The Cambodian Department of Immigration runs an online registration app called the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://fpcs.immigration.gov.kh/login\">Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS)</a>.

There have been a small number of grenade or bomb attacks and shootings. Most have been linked to business, personal and traffic disputes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-thailand\">Border with Thailand</h3>\n\n<p>The line of the international border near the Preah Vihear temple (Khaoi Pra Viharn in Thai) has been in dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, with occasional clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops. There have also been disputes over control of the Ta Moan and Ta Krabey temples, which are close to the Thailand-Cambodia border.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when travelling in this area, and follow the instructions of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-national-borders\">Other national borders</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the local security situation in border regions and at land crossings between countries. Get local advice before you set off. At the more remote crossing points, conditions can be basic. Local officials and tour operators can ask for unofficial fees or inflate visa prices at land borders. Make sure you know the correct visa requirements and fees before you travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>Cambodia remains heavily affected by landmines and unexploded weapons. Mined areas are often unmarked. Do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stray off main routes in rural areas, including around temple complexes</li>\n  <li>pick up metal objects</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"organised-crime\">Organised crime</h3>\n\n<p>A bomb was left near a casino in Phnom Penh in December 2022 and there was a shooting in the same month. Both were likely linked to organised crime, and tourists were not targeted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Most incidents of theft are bag snatchings, often by thieves riding past on motorbikes. Thieves will cut bag straps and snatch bags or phones from tourists on foot or in tuk-tuks and motorbikes, often causing injury. There have been incidents on bus journeys where passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotspots-for-petty-crime-include\">Hotspots for petty crime include:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the riverfront and BKK areas of Phnom Penh</li>\n  <li>the beaches and tourist areas of Sihanoukville and nearby islands</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"to-protect-yourself-and-your-belongings\">To protect yourself and your belongings:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use a hotel safe for your valuables</li>\n  <li>take extra care at night and in isolated areas and stick to well-used, well-lit roads</li>\n  <li>carry a personal alarm if possible</li>\n  <li>minimise the items you carry with you</li>\n  <li>carry bags on the side of you that is furthest from the road</li>\n  <li>do not place bags in the front basket of bicycles</li>\n  <li>try to travel in tuk-tuks with metal grills on the back and side that offer some protection against bag snatching</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-safety-and-sexual-assault\">Personal safety and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Female travellers, including British nationals have been sexually assaulted in Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. This includes incidents of lone women being sexually assaulted by men claiming to be motorbike taxi drivers in the Pub Street area of Siem Reap. Be wary of approaches from strangers and offers of transport.</p>\n\n<p>Parties, including organised dance parties on Cambodia\u2019s islands, may place you at risk of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>sexual assault</li>\n  <li>robbery</li>\n  <li>injury</li>\n  <li>arrest</li>\n  <li>losing belongings, including travel documents</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Islands are often isolated and access to medical or emergency assistance is limited or non-existent.</p>\n\n<p>Cambodians are friendly, but you should be wary if a Cambodian or other foreign national befriends you quickly and invites you to their home or hotel to meet their family.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Police have reported instances of drink spiking in some bars visited by foreigners. Do not leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Travellers have reported fake dollar bills being given as change in shops and clubs. You should check that notes you receive are genuine and are not damaged or torn.</p>\n\n<p>Be sceptical if offered an opportunity of easy work. Sophisticated job scams, mostly in and around Sihanoukville and Kandal, operate by advertising \u2018easy jobs with high pay\u2019. These jobs turned out to be long hours of factory work where pay was low and free movement was allegedly restricted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug offences in Cambodia are severe and can include long jail sentences for possession of even small quantities of recreational drugs. Drugs have also caused the death of several foreign travellers. These are likely to be the result of impurities, or from being mixed with unknown substances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>To report a crime:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in Phnom Penh, go to the Tourist Police at Street 598, 12107 (Tel +855 (0)12 942 484).</li>\n  <li>in Siem Reap, go to the Tourist Police office which is next to the ticketing booth for the Angkor temple ruins.</li>\n  <li>in Sihanoukville, Battambang and other towns in Cambodia, check with the local police for which police station to which you should report.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Local law enforcement response to a crime, including a violent crime, is often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>police stations closed</li>\n  <li>emergency telephone numbers unanswered</li>\n  <li>police unwilling to investigate</li>\n  <li>police unable to speak English</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There should be no cost for police to issue a police report. If police are demanding a fee, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Cambodia&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Phnom%20Penh\">contact the British Embassy Phnom Penh</a> and give details of the police station.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"prison-sentences-and-conditions\">Prison sentences and conditions</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re arrested and convicted of a crime in Cambodia, you can expect a long prison sentence. Pre-trial detention can also last many months.</p>\n\n<p>The legal process in Cambodia is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard of the UK. The British Embassy will not interfere in the legal processes of a host country.</p>\n\n<p>The conditions in Cambodian prisons are extremely poor and overcrowded. Medical facilities in prisons are also very poor. The UK has no prisoner transfer agreement with Cambodia so if you\u2019re found guilty you can expect to serve your full prison term in Cambodia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visits-to-religious-sites\">Visits to religious sites</h3>\n\n<p>The Cambodian authorities have issued an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.siemreap.net/guides/angkor/angkor-visitor-code-of-conduct/\">official code of conduct for visitors</a> to Angkor Wat and other religious sites. You may be refused admission to the sites if you wear skirts or shorts above the knee, or if you have bare shoulders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Never take photographs on or near military bases. Ask permission before taking pictures of people, especially monks and other religious figures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surveys-research-and-unusual-travel-plans\">Surveys, research and unusual travel plans</h3>\n\n<p>You should get permission from the district head, provincial governor or national tourism authority for any travel considered as out of the ordinary, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>carrying out surveys</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>extensive photography</li>\n  <li>scientific research of any kind</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual relationships are legal in Cambodia. The LGBT+ community is becoming more visible, through gay clubs, club nights and the work of some human rights organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adopting-cambodian-children\">Adopting Cambodian children</h3>\n\n<p>The UK government has suspended all adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"commercial-surrogacy\">Commercial surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>Commercial surrogacy is banned in Cambodia. If you pay a surrogate, you could get a fine or a prison sentence. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> and Home Office have produced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance for anyone considering surrogacy abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"phone-and-data-connections\">Phone and data connections</h3>\n\n<p>While there is good wi-fi and mobile phone networks in the main cities and towns of Cambodia, many of the islands and remote areas are not well covered. Make sure your friends and family are aware that you may be out of contact.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-and-safety\">Health and safety</h3>\n\n<p>Cambodia does not have the same health and safety standards as in the UK. Be aware that safety advice will be minimal and there may be no warning signs about dangers at tourist sites.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"jungle-treks\">Jungle treks</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering jungle trekking, use a reputable tour guide. There\u2019s no licensing system for tour guides, so get advice from your hotel, and look at online reviews before hiring a guide.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-based-activities\">Water-based activities</h3>\n\n<p>When swimming, kayaking, rafting, or using jet-skis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take extra care in the rainy season from May to October</li>\n  <li>watch for river currents \u2013 these can be extremely strong and there have been fatalities because of this</li>\n  <li>beware of jellyfish in the sea close to the shore \u2013 their sting can be fatal</li>\n  <li>take local advice from hotel management and rent equipment only from recommended operators</li>\n  <li>check for damage before using any equipment</li>\n  <li>insist on training and ask operators to explain safe practices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving\">Diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving school standards are not always as high as in the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check a dive operator\u2019s credentials</li>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re covered by insurance</li>\n  <li>make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen</li>\n  <li>ask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have not had any previous diving experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your dive instructor to explain what cover they offer before signing up</li>\n  <li>check what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Cambodia has one of the highest rates of road traffic accidents in south-east Asia. There are high numbers of fatalities and serious injuries. Many accidents are due to poor vehicle and driver safety standards. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of accidents.</p>\n\n<p>You need\u202fa 1949 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> to get a Cambodian driving licence for cars or motorcycles.\u202fYou cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you have your <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> with you, you can apply for a Cambodian licence. Some local travel agencies can arrange this for a fee.</p>\n\n<p>Driving or riding without a licence may invalidate your travel insurance and police may impound your vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorcycles\">Motorcycles</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling as a passenger by motorcycle taxi (\u2018moto Dop\u2019) is dangerous. Vehicles are poorly maintained and driving standards are low. There is also a risk that thieves (also on motorcycles) will snatch bags from you, particularly in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.</p>\n\n<p>The police can impose an on-the-spot fine if you ride a motorcycle without a helmet. Riding without a helmet may also invalidate your insurance. The police can stop tourists without Cambodian driving licences and impose a fine. In Sihanoukville, it\u2019s a requirement for police to issue a receipt when issuing a fine for a traffic violation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-hire\">Vehicle hire</h3>\n\n<p>Before you hire a vehicle, check drivers and any passengers are covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the rental agreement. Do not hand over your passport as a guarantee for returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>Accidents have happened when boats are overloaded or poorly maintained. Tourist boats sometimes operate despite weather warnings, particularly between Sihanoukville and the nearby islands.</p>\n\n<p>Water levels in rivers and lakes are high during the rainy season (June to October), making currents faster and more dangerous. Boat travel on rivers is difficult in the dry season (March to May), due to the exposure of sandbars and other hazards that can damage boats or cause them to run aground.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Heavy storms during the monsoon season from June to October disrupt and damage the road network. Travel to some provinces can be seriously restricted by landslides at this time. Poor drainage results in flooded roads, causing major traffic congestion and delays in Phnom Penh (including along the route to the airport).</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mrcmekong.org/\">Mekong River Commission</a> posts official updates on the Mekong River. Monitor local news and weather reports, and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/country.html?countryCode=KHM\">weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Lakes, caves and waterfalls are particularly prone to dangerous flash flooding during the rainy season from June to October.</p>\n\n",

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as shopping areas in major cities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnap is a risk in South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. Paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can increase the risk of hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There are regular protests and demonstrations that can turn violent. Violence could affect participants and bystanders. This can happen anywhere in South Africa at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid areas where protests, demonstrations, or marches are taking place, especially in city centres and townships. Do not cross protester roadblocks. This could provoke a violent reaction. Monitor local and social media for updates, including local radio. Where possible stick to major routes and be aware that GPS services could divert you into less secure areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high crime rate, including carjacking, \u2018smash and grab\u2019 attacks on vehicles house robbery, rape, sexual assault and murder. Violent crime can take place anywhere, including in tourist destinations and transport hubs.\u00a0 Most violent crimes occur in townships on the outskirts of major cities or in isolated areas. The threat is higher in central business districts of major cities than in suburban areas, and increases after dark.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of violent crime to visitors in the main tourist cities is generally low. There is usually additional security personnel in the main tourist areas who can assist tourists. However, policing and security can be limited, so always remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>To protect your personal safety:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not have valuables on show</li>\n  <li>do not leave valuables in your car</li>\n  <li>take safe and reliable transport <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/safety-and-security#public-transport\">see public transport</a>\n</li>\n  <li>stay alert and be wary of people who approach you</li>\n  <li>do not walk around after dark</li>\n  <li>travel with friends and make sure someone knows your plans</li>\n  <li>if you visit a township, only go with a responsible and reliable tour guide.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information on crime statistics, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=737&amp;id=5=5\">Statistics South Africa website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fraud-and-scams\">Fraud and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the risk of scams, including through business or employment opportunities, visa facilitation or offers of romance and friendships.</p>\n\n<p>Card skimming and confidence scams are widespread. There has been an increase in cybercrime and internet scamming. Do not meet up with or send money to someone you do not know.</p>\n\n<p>Crime around ATMs is common. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>hide your PIN when withdrawing money or paying by card</li>\n  <li>be aware of fraudsters, such as strangers offering to \u201chelp\u201d when your card doesn\u2019t work, or who try to lure you to an ATM</li>\n  <li>change large sums of money in banks or secure shopping malls, not in busy public areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you use a visa agent, be wary of fraud. Always follow the correct visa application process through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/applying-for-sa-visa\">Department of Home Affairs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals often use the details of embassies to carry out their fraud. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals may pose as officials for financial or personal gain. If in doubt, ask to see their ID and move into a safe, public and open space. All police officers must carry their Appointment Certificate on them. If you have any concerns, call:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>police on 10111</li>\n  <li>emergency services on 112</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h3>\n\n<p>The threat of kidnap throughout South Africa is increasing. Kidnaps are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. In recent years, several foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped. There have been reports of young children being kidnapped from shops, shopping malls and beaches.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals can be seen as wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk of kidnap for financial gain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airport-safety\">Airport safety</h3>\n\n<p>Crime can happen in and around the airport, including robbery and theft of baggage and valuables. People have been followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to their destinations and then robbed, often at gunpoint. You should be careful when following GPS navigation. You should avoid taking alternative routes away from main roads as this can often take you into less secure areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be careful in and around the airport</li>\n  <li>use main roads and highways when driving to and from airports</li>\n  <li>go through public areas quickly</li>\n  <li>avoid isolated areas</li>\n  <li>consider being met on arrival by your hotel or tour operator</li>\n  <li>go to your connecting flight quickly if in transit</li>\n  <li>consider vacuum-wrapping luggage if local regulations allow</li>\n  <li>keep valuables in your carry-on luggage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specifically for travel to and from Cape Town International Airport, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stick to the M3 and N2 where possible, and avoid the R300 and the R310 (Baden Powell) between Muizenberg and the N2 intersection</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-hijacking-and-robbery\">Vehicle hijacking and robbery</h3>\n\n<p>Vehicle hijacking and robbery are common, particularly after dark and around traffic lights, junctions, petrol stations and driveways. It is common for thieves to break car windows and take valuable while cars are waiting at a junction.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals sometimes force a vehicle to stop so they can rob those inside. Common tactics include throwing spikes (sometimes hidden in plastic bags), stones or glass in front of the vehicle. If you are targeted, drive as far as possible, or to a place of safety, before you stop.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals may pose as police and use \u2018blue lights\u2019 on plain (often white) vehicles to stop motorists and steal the vehicle. If you are suspicious, do not stop and continue to a police station, petrol station or other place of safety to call the police.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t pick up strangers or stop to help apparently distressed motorists. Continue driving and report the incident to the police. If you are involved in a hijacking, stay calm and surrender your valuables and your vehicle if asked. Do not resist.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of long queues leading to armed robberies and express kidnappings close to the Lembombo border at Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. These often take place after dark. Consider whether you can use a different crossing or only approach the border during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce your risk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check your route for any hazards or disruptions before you set off</li>\n  <li>use a GPS, but take care it does not divert you into less secure areas</li>\n  <li>keep to main roads and park in well-lit areas</li>\n  <li>always take care and consider your surroundings</li>\n  <li>avoid being stationary inside your vehicle for long periods</li>\n  <li>check your car is locked when you leave it</li>\n  <li>keep your windows closed, especially when stopped at junctions</li>\n  <li>keep valuables out of sight, ideally kept in the boot of the vehicle</li>\n  <li>ask your hire car company for a vehicle with \u2018smash and grab\u2019 film installed on the windows</li>\n  <li>ensure you can see the tarmac and the tyres of the car in front of you when you stop your vehicle, giving you space to escape if you need to</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h2>\n\n<p>There are ongoing nationwide power shortages with rolling power cuts.

Be mindful that health and safety standards vary globally and may not be the same as you can expect in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, insist on a receiving a safety briefing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kruger-national-park\">Kruger National Park</h3>\n\n<p>After a violent attack that killed a tourist, South Africa National Parks (SANParks) advise against using the Numbi gate entrance to Kruger National Park. There have been protests and violent incidents on the R538 road leading to the gate.</p>\n\n<p>Follow SANParks advice on using alternative entrances. If you stay outside the park, contact your lodge in advance to find out if any disruptions will affect your trip. Get up-to-date <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/\">SANParks news</a> on the park website.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beach-safety\">Beach safety</h3>\n\n<p>Beach conditions and local safety measures vary. Every year, many people drown due to strong sea currents. You should ask for a life-jacket if you decide to participate in water sports.</p>\n\n<p>On beaches where there is no equipment or warning signs, speak to local people who know the conditions. If in doubt, do not enter the water.</p>\n\n<p>On busier tourist beaches, only swim between the red and yellow flags, read the warning signs and follow instructions from lifeguards.

Make sure you use a reliable service, book the service in the app and check the vehicle registration and identity before entering the vehicle. Do not wait in the street and keep your phone or valuables out of sight. When inside the vehicle, ask the driver to close rear windows and lock doors if you cannot do so yourself. At airports, be wary of unregulated drivers posing as Uber or other e-hailing service drivers. If you order an e-hailing service, go to the designated area to wait.</p>\n\n<p>Tension between e-hailing service drivers and metered taxi drivers can lead to armed violence, particularly around Gautrain stations and airports. Strikes and protests by e-hailing service drivers are also known to take place with some attacks against drivers not seen to be participating. Passengers have been harassed or caught up in violence. High-risk areas are generally flagged in the relevant app, but exercise caution when using e-hailing services. During times of strike action find alternative reliable private transportation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"driving-standards-and-road-conditions\">Driving standards and road conditions</h4>\n\n<p>Driving standards vary in South Africa. Fatal road accidents are common, particularly around weekends and major public holidays.</p>\n\n<p>On highways, overtaking or undertaking can occur in any lane including the hard shoulder. On single-lane roads, the hard shoulder is also sometimes used by trucks and slower vehicles to allow faster vehicles to overtake. At most intersections, including 4-way stops and where traffic lights are out of service due to power outages, the first vehicle to arrive generally has priority. On larger roundabouts, you should give way to the right, although this rule is often ignored. Small roundabouts (called circles) are treated the same as a 4-way stop.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are mostly very good. Some roads in remote areas are less well maintained and may have potholes. If you are travelling to a lodge in a remote area, check road conditions with the lodge management as a car with good ground clearance may be required. Drive cautiously, obey speed limits and avoid unfamiliar areas at night. To avoid running out of fuel, keep fuel levels above half a tank. Learn more about road safety awareness on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.arrivealive.co.za/\">Arrive Alive website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a car, save the emergency roadside assistance numbers. Download an offline map if you do not have access to a GPS.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling to and from Cape Town International airport, you should stick to the M3 and N2 where possible, and avoid the R300 and the R310 (Baden Powell) between Muizenberg and the N2 intersection.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"driving-licences-in-south-africa\">Driving licences in South Africa</h4>\n\n<p>You can drive in South Africa with a valid UK photocard driving licence for up to 12 months. If you have a paper licence, you should also get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you become a permanent resident, exchange your UK licence for a local licence within 12 months of getting your residency. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-south-africa\">Living in South Africa guide</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>These transport options are generally safe and reliable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\u2018Gautrain\u2019 train between Johannesburg, Pretoria and OR Tambo International Airport. Do not walk to or from Gautrain stations after dark</li>\n  <li>MyCiTi bus in Cape Town (central business district and Atlantic Seaboard). Do not travel into townships by MyCiTi bus. There have been violent attacks reported in Khayelitsha</li>\n  <li>airport shuttle buses through internationally recognised hotels.</li>\n  <li>internationally recognised e-hailing apps where bookings are confirmed through the app</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some transport services can be unreliable and passengers have been subject to theft and violence. These include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>minibus taxis</li>\n  <li>Metrorail train services</li>\n  <li>long-distance public train and coach services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"borders\">Borders</h2>\n\n<p>South Africa shares a border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Botswana. Be careful when crossing land borders and avoid crossing at night. Border queues can be a target for crime. Protests can happen at some border crossings, particularly at the Mozambique border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Heavy rainfall often leads to widespread flooding.

Attacks, including in Yangon and Naypyitaw,  primarily continue to target military or regime-affiliated locations such as government buildings and checkpoints, and military-owned businesses. However, attacks may impact civilian bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and serviced accommodation complexes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Before you travel, <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a> for Myanmar\u2019s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\"><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is conflict and significant violence across much of Myanmar, involving air strikes, artillery bombardments, landmines and armed clashes. While normal daily life has resumed in many urban centres, armed groups are likely to try to carry out attacks. Shootings and explosions are common, particularly around times of increased political tension. There have been attacks against military personnel, state infrastructure (e.g. police stations, traffic police huts, ward administration centres and electricity company offices), and businesses perceived as affiliated with the military. Areas frequented by foreigners (e.g. lodging/hotels, shopping areas and restaurants) could also be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>There are increasing reports of attacks on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and National Highway 1 linking Yangon to Mandalay. For more information <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/safety-and-security#yangon-mandalay-expressway\">see Yangon-Mandalay Expressway</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Yangon, Naypyitaw, Bago, Ayarwaddy or Southern Rakhine, remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice. You should ensure you are aware of local rules, norms, and restrictions, especially if travelling to townships under martial law. You should seek advice from local tour operators before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>In Yangon, the townships currently under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but these are subject to change.  See  the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/safety-and-security\">\u2018Safety and security\u2019</a> page for more details.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk to foreigners of arbitrary arrest and detention, though this is much higher for journalists and activists. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Minor infractions of the law can provide grounds for arrest. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Myanmar are particularly sensitive to all forms of independent reporting and journalistic activity.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.

Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.</p>\n\n<p>Plan ahead and make sure you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>can access money</li>\n  <li>understand what your insurance will cover</li>\n  <li>can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-in-myanmar\">Travel in Myanmar</h2>\n\n<p>A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access is subject to regular change.  You should contact individual airlines for details. You should comply with overnight curfews, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you attempt to travel domestically, you are likely to encounter police or military checkpoints on your journey.</p>\n\n<p>Due to extra COVID-19 checks, it is advisable that foreigners carry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passport</li>\n  <li>Form C (immigration document)</li>\n  <li>Foreigner\u2019s Registration Certificate</li>\n  <li>Myanmar Driver\u2019s Licence (if you own a car)</li>\n  <li>a copy of your passport information page</li>\n  <li>a copy of your Myanmar visa</li>\n  <li>a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar</li>\n  <li>COVID-19 documentation e.g. proof of vaccination</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n\n<p>There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guesthouses, and not in private apartments. Due to COVID-19, this is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.</p>\n\n<p>Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. You should make sure you have you accommodation booked before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-places-and-services\">Public places and services</h2>\n\n<p>COVID-19 restrictions remain in place. You must wear a face mask in public places. Failure to wear a mask may result in a fine.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 restrictions and policies may change without notice. You are advised to follow local media for updates or check locally within the township where you are.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare\">Healthcare</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of COVID-19, you should consult your healthcare provider. There are a small number of private hospitals in Yangon that are equipped to manage patients with severe symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>If you test positive for the virus, you may be transferred to a government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. These vary in quality. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food.</p>\n\n<p>It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention if you have COVID-19. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.</p>\n\n<p>Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in Myanmar. Most hospitals, both government and private, have their own pharmacies. A government hospital will provide a prescription for collection at their pharmacy once a patient has been assessed. To attend a private hospital or clinic you must first register, following an assessment any prescription can be collected at the pharmacy on their premises. If you are on regular medication, bring sufficient supplies with you, or is able to have their medication couriered from the UK.</p>\n\n<p>For contact details for English-speaking doctors <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners\">visit our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Myanmar held national elections on 8 November 2020, in which the National League of Democracy Party won a majority. The military subsequently alleged fraud in the elections and demanded a review. On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and assumed control by force. There has been widespread political violence involving the deaths of hundreds of ordinary people, as well as a major rise in active clashes between armed actors.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher likelihood of opposition attacks and an increased presence of security forces on occasions of national significance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Myanmar National Day (4 January)</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February)</li>\n  <li>Union Day (12 February)</li>\n  <li>Peasants Day (2 March)</li>\n  <li>Armed Forces Day (27 March)</li>\n  <li>Martyrs\u2019 Day (19 July)</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the execution of political prisoners (23-25 July)</li>\n  <li>the lapsing of the state of emergency (1 August)</li>\n  <li>the 8888 uprising (8 August)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, others may have curfews or \u2018stay at home\u2019 orders, for example, in Yangon, a number of townships have a curfew from 1AM-3AM. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you arrive in an area.</p>\n\n<p>Opposition activists regularly detonate small-scale improvised explosive devices across the country. Military and government buildings; police stations; and businesses, hotels and restaurants affiliated to the military (or perceived to be) are the main targets, but there have also been attacks on schools and hospitals. While small-scale, these devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the attacks more deadly.</p>\n\n<p>Following the execution of high-profile political prisoners on 25 July 2022, there has been an increase in tensions across the country and the number of explosions in public places. Visitors to Myanmar should be extra vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. You should not attempt to photograph any gatherings.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/local-laws-and-customs#photography-and-drones\">Photography and drones</a> for more information. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring military instructions or ignoring curfews could lead to detention and/or lengthy prison sentences. Curfews are in place nationwide. Local wards may unexpectedly change rules and curfew times and it is important to remain updated on local rules.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yangon-region\">Yangon region</h2>\n\n<p>Whilst we no longer advise against all but essential travel to Yangon region, there is still a heightened risk. The security situation remains volatile and can change at short notice. If you are in the Yangon region, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice, especially if travelling to townships which are under martial law. The townships currently under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but this is subject to change.</p>\n\n<p>Security incidents in Yangon, like in the rest of Myanmar, continue to primarily target military regime-affiliated locations and personnel but may impact civilians and bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals. This may include hotels, restaurants and accommodation complexes. Military installations, such as checkpoints, are also targets. If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don\u2019t try to make your way through it. Turn around and move to safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yangon-mandalay-expressway\">Yangon-Mandalay expressway</h3>\n\n<p>There are reports of an increasing number of attacks on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and National Highway 1 linking Yangon to Mandalay. These have included the use of landmines and improvised explosive devices. There is an increased risk of attacks after dark, and an unofficial curfew is in place. You should exercise vigilance and use these roads during daylight only.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are no accurate official  statistics on violent crime or robbery against foreigners. Anecdotal evidence suggests that cases are low, although the economic pressure may cause an increase. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times. You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends, employers or hosts.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar is largely a cash society. Make sure you have access to cash, but avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold or semi-precious stones. This could result in a substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scams\">Scams</h2>\n\n<p>Be aware of job offers that appear \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d in Myanmar and neighbouring countries. There is a growing number of cyber scam centres operating in eastern Myanmar \u2013 particularly the Myawaddy district in eastern Kayin and Tachileik township in eastern Shan. Victims are trafficked into undertaking online scamming, held in poor living conditions, and subjected to severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated, and been held to ransom.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of fraudulent emails being sent by individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have falsely stated they are acting on advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/stay-alert-to-fraud-and-financial-scams-abroad\">fraud and financial scams</a> for further guidance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h2>\n\n<p>The UK advises against all travel to Northern Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni and Mon States, Sagaing Region and Tanintharyi Region excluding Myeik township, the archipelago and townships south of Tanintharyi Township. The UK advises against all but essential travel to Shan State and Southern Taninthartharyi Region.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of Ethnic Armed Organisations in Myanmar\u2019s border areas.</p>\n\n<p>Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas. The Myanmar authorities restrict travel to most border areas. There are active military operations involving the use of air strikes, artillery bombardments and ground troops.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2023, Ethnic Armed Organisations launched a military offensive in Shan State North. Travellers on the Mandalay-Lashio road should remain vigilant and exercise caution due to a heightened risk of attacks \u2013 particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>As a result of decades of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high - particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is evidence of landmine use having spread to other areas since the coup. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, but this practice is not widespread.  Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XY\">Aviation Safety Network</a>. A Myanmar National Airlines plane was shot at in Kayah in October 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren\u2019t always advised in advance where this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges can be damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Serious road accidents are common. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor condition. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n\n<p>Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards, and search and rescue facilities may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger ferries in Rakhine State have been subject to attacks.</p>\n\n<p>During the monsoon season (May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/burma/health\">Health</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phones-and-internet\">Mobile phones and Internet</h2>\n\n<p>The Myanmar authorities periodically cut off access to the Internet and have blocked several websites.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s technological infrastructure has improved. International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<p>Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive. This can then be topped up as needed.</p>\n\n",

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"criminal-justice\">Criminal justice</h2>\n\n<p>There is a risk of arbitrary detention and arrest, particularly for journalists and human rights activists. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re arrested and convicted of a crime in Myanmar you can expect a long prison sentence. Conditions in detention are extremely poor. Pre-trial detention can last many months.</p>\n\n<p>The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. British nationals in Myanmar should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual abuse against children is a serious crime. Those who commit sex offences against children abroad can also be prosecuted in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug trafficking range from a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring potentially arbitrary charges which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs</h2>\n\n<p>Respect religious customs when visiting Buddhist religious sites. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery.</p>\n\n<p>Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term, and can include any disrespectful depiction or image (including tattoos) of Buddha or other religious representation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"photography-and-drones\">Photography and drones</h2>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs or videos of the police, any demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior government permission and flying them in sensitive areas such as government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. As it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable. If you wish to bring a drone to Myanmar, you\u2019re strongly advised to seek official permission from the Myanmar authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"endangered-species\">Endangered species</h2>\n\n<p>Myanmar is party to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cites.org/\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)</a>. Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by CITES and EU legislation. You should consider the restrictions on the export of endangered species under CITES when deciding whether to buy exotic souvenirs, including those made from turtles.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h2>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Myanmar, although in practice these laws are not consistently enforced. These laws can carry punishments of up to life imprisonment and apply equally to men and women. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes, and allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention.</p>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards LGBT+ people can be mixed. Up until recently, there have been increasingly large Pride festivals and growing visibility of the LGBT+ community, including gay bars and clubs. Public displays of affection, whether heterosexual or LGBT+, are frowned upon in Myanmar culture.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n",

In areas where an overnight curfew is in place, such as Yangon, you may struggle to access emergency healthcare during the night.</p>\n\n<p>Many pharmaceutical products for sale in Myanmar are believed to be counterfeit.</p>\n\n<p>Competent medical advice and treatment may not be available outside Yangon and Mandalay, and any services provided will not be to the standard of those in the UK. You may need expensive medical evacuation costing up to tens of thousands of pounds. Make sure you have adequate <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel health insurance</a> and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Avoid intrusive examinations, including emergency dental work, due to irregular hygiene standards and the danger of infection, particularly by hepatitis B and C and HIV/AIDS.  Psychological and psychiatric services are also limited.</p>\n\n<p>Cash payment is often needed prior to receiving medical treatment in Myanmar. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and/or repatriation. The UK government can not pay for medical expenses overseas.</p>\n\n<p>The worldwide coronavirus outbreak is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar\u2019s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and Chikunguya are present in Myanmar. You should take <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">appropriate precautions</a> to avoid being bitten by mosquitos. For further advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/156/burma-myanmar\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/156/burma-myanmar#Other_risks\">schistosomiasis</a>, a parasitic infection, have been reported in Myanmar. There is no vaccine or medication to prevent schistosomiasis. You should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater. As the infection may cause no symptoms, all travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a medical assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has faced challenges with outbreaks of Vaccine Derived Polio Viruses (VDPV), particularly in remote areas.  All travellers should check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> pages for specific advice on polio vaccinations</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution\">Air pollution</h2>\n<p>Air pollution can affect major urban areas. This may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check real-time air-quality data for Yangon on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aqicn.org/city/maynmar/rangoon/us-embassy/\">World Air Quality Index website</a>.</p>\n",

Muslim tourists may perform Umrah on a tourist visa, but a separate visa is needed for Hajj. See separate guidance on the Umrah application process in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/pilgrimage\">Pilgrimage section</a></p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling to Saudi Arabia for tourism, business, medical treatment or to study, you can apply for an Electronic Visa Waiver. An EVW permits a single entry visit of up to six months. You can apply for an EVW through the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/\">visas portal</a>.  You must have a confirmed flight booking and apply for your EVW from 90 days to 48 hours prior to your trip. Tourist visas are valid for 360 days from the date of issue and can be used for visits of up to 90 days. A daily fine will be levied if you overstay your visa.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling for any other purpose, you should apply for a visa through visa agencies accredited to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia. If you overstay your visa you will be fined and deported.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re transiting through Saudi Arabia, you may need a transit visa if the connecting time between your flights is more than 12 hours. Once the ticket is issued, you should confirm with your airline or travel agency if you need a transit visa. You should be able to apply for a transit visa through your airline, travel agency or through an established agent via the visa section of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.mofa.gov.sa/sites/uk/EN/Pages/default.aspx\">Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel to Saudi Arabia via the causeway from Bahrain, you should check the terms of your Saudi visa before travelling. If you\u2019re planning to apply for a visa, you should seek advice (eg from your visa agent, the Saudi Embassy or your employer) about the visa options available to you. Saudi visas may only allow for entry into the country by air and may prevent you from entering across a land border including via the causeway from Bahrain.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel around the time of Hajj, check with your airline for any restrictions. In previous years, the Directorate of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia have restricted visitors who are not performing Hajj from flying to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. During this time, visitors may need a valid Hajj visa to be allowed to board flights to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. Visitors with business or visit visas will still be able to enter Saudi Arabia through other entry points.</p>\n\n<p>British residents in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/191/saudi-arabia#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-israel\">Previous travel to Israel</h3>\n\n<p>You may be refused entry to Saudi Arabia if your passport contains evidence of previous travel to Israel or indicates Israel as your birthplace.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-travellers\">Female travellers</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a female visitor arriving on a non-tourist visa, or a resident, you must be met by your sponsor on arrival.

You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of\u00a0Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about living in Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-saudi-arabia#:~:text=in%20Saudi%20Arabia.-,Working%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia,while%20you%20retain%20your%20Iqama.\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Saudi Arabia in 2024 is expected to take place between 10 March and 8 April. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"rules-of-behaviour\">Rules of behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Men and women are required to refrain from public displays of affection. Swearing and making rude gestures are considered offensive acts and violators can be subjected to the local laws. Penalties can vary from a fine to imprisonment and/or deported. For more information on rules of behaviour in Saudi Arabia, please refer to the official page of\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/understand\">Visit Saudi</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Local laws require men and women to dress modestly covering shoulders and knees in public, avoiding tight-fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images. It is not mandatory for female travellers to wear the traditional robe or abaya. Information on important laws and etiquette around dress codes is available to visitors on the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/\">Visit Saudi website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Both men and women are advised not to wear shorts or sleeveless tops, when going to government buildings, airports, health care facilities or malls. If you do not dress modestly, you may be asked to leave or be denied entry to these locations. Dressing modestly is important especially during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography-and-media\">Photography and media</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities. Filming or photographing government buildings, military installations, and palaces is not allowed. \u00a0You should avoid photographing local people.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to post anything online that could be seen to criticise, insult or ridicule the:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Saudi government or authorities</li>\n  <li>King, Crown Prince or Royal Family</li>\n  <li>country\u2019s culture and beliefs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could get a long prison sentence, even for posts published outside Saudi Arabia many years ago.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re likely come under more scrutiny if you\u2019re a British national who also:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>carries Saudi citizenship</li>\n  <li>has close Saudi relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you wish to carry out media activity related to the production, transmission and/or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video and/or visual information, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permission from\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gcam.gov.sa/\">the General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM)</a>\u00a0in advance. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment and a substantial fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-drivers\">Female drivers</h3>\n\n<p>As of June 2018, women are legally able to obtain a licence to drive a car, motorbikes and scooters. You should seek guidance from the local authorities on how to apply for a local licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt--sexual-relations-outside-marriage\">LGBT / Sexual relations outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual or extra-marital sexual relations, including adultery, are illegal and can be subject to severe penalties. It\u2019s also illegal to be transgender. Transgender people travelling to Saudi Arabia are likely to face significant difficulties and risks if this is discovered by the authorities. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Living together whilst unmarried is prohibited. Any intimacy in public between men and women (including between teenagers) can lead to arrest. Penalties can include arrest and a potential court case where the judgement can include a fine, a custodial sentence and deportation once the sentence is complete. This is especially so where the behaviour has caused offence.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the laws on sex outside marriage, if you become pregnant outside marriage, both you and your partner could face imprisonment and/or deportation. Doctors will ask for proof of marriage during antenatal checks. An unmarried woman who gives birth in Saudi Arabia may also encounter problems when registering the birth of the child in Saudi Arabia, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the Saudi authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate and the authorities may compare the date of the marriage against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-goods-and-customs\">Importing goods and customs</h3>\n\n<p>Saudi law prohibits the importation of weapons, alcohol, narcotics, pork and pork products, pornographic materials, distillery equipment, re-treaded or used tyres, used clothing and certain sculptures.</p>\n\n<p>Personal videos, books, and magazines may be subjected to scrutiny and be censored on arrival. In addition, electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<p>Special approval from the Saudi authorities\u2019 on items such as agricultural seeds, live animals, books, periodicals, movies, and tapes; religious books and tapes; chemicals and harmful materials; pharmaceutical products; wireless equipment and radio-controlled model airplanes, and archaeological artefacts\u2019 requires. For additional information, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.saso.gov.sa/en/pages/default.aspx\">The Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO)</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs-and-narcotics-control\">Drugs and narcotics control</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences in Saudi Arabia. The penalties for the use of, trafficking, smuggling and possession of drugs (even residual amounts) are severe.</p>\n\n<p>Punishment can include lengthy custodial sentences, heavy fines, deportation, and death penalty. For further information, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/Home/sectors/narcoticscontrol\">the Saudi Ministry of Interior</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Some prescribed and over the counter medicines may be controlled substances in Saudi Arabia. If you need to bring in controlled/prescription medication, ensure you carry your official doctor\u2019s prescription, hospital note or a letter from your GP, detailing the drug, the quantity prescribed and dosage. This note or letter should also be signed by the doctor / consultant and stamped by the hospital. A list of narcotic, psychotropic and controlled drugs where this rule applies, allowed quantities and documents to present can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sfda.gov.sa/sites/default/files/2021-09/Drug12112019e1.pdf\">the\u00a0Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority (SFDA) procedures and controls of narcotics and psychotropic substances</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>It is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. British nationals have been detained under this law, usually when they have come to the attention of the police on a related matter, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour. Penalties for the possession of, or trade in alcohol are severe. Both result in prison sentences. Do not arrive in Saudi Arabia under the influence of alcohol.  Do not bring alcohol into Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n\n<p>The public practice of any form of religion other than Islam is illegal; as is an intention to convert others. However, the Saudi authorities accept the private practice of religions other than Islam, and you can bring a religious text into the country as long as it is for your personal use. Importing larger quantities than this can carry severe penalties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-equipment\">Technical equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Binoculars should not be brought into Saudi Arabia and may be confiscated at the port of entry.</p>\n\n<p>Equipment like satellite phones, listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras or binoculars, may require a licence for use in Saudi Arabia. Seek advice from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carrying-two-passports\">Carrying two passports</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to hold two passports in Saudi Arabia. The immigration authorities will confiscate second passports if they are discovered.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry a photocopy of your passport for identification. Make sure you have included emergency contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-system-and-due-process\">Legal system and due process</h3>\n\n<p>The Saudi legal system differs in many ways from the UK. Suspects can be held without charge and are not always allowed quick access to legal representation. The Saudi authorities have detained witnesses and victims of crimes. If you need consular assistance, British Embassy staff will try to visit you as soon as they are aware of the case, but in some instances, Embassy staff have not been permitted to do so immediately or have had access limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crimes\">Financial crimes</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud, bribery, embezzlement, giving somebody a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and \u2018security cheques\u2019) and non-payment of bills (for example hotel bills or car hire) can result in imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>Bank accounts and other assets may be frozen. You may also be liable for cheques that you have signed on behalf of a company.</p>\n\n<p>If you have unpaid loans or financial commitments you won\u2019t be able to cancel your residence permit, and may find yourself subject to a travel ban which will prevent you from travelling or leaving the country. All debts should be settled in full before you leave the country. Ask your bank for a certificate to confirm you have no outstanding debt once you have cleared the balance.</p>\n\n<p>Equally, you may find that there is a block on your government services, which prevents the renewal of your residents ID, issuing the re-entry/exit visa, or transferring to a new sponsor (employer) and any end of service benefits you may be entitled to could be used to offset the outstanding debt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone involved in a commercial dispute with a Saudi company or individual may be prevented from leaving the country pending resolution of the dispute. Government bodies often retain passports for official purposes; sponsors also sometimes retain passports, although this is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deportation\">Deportation</h3>\n\n<p>If you are found guilty of committing an offence and are sentenced to over 3 months, the Saudi authorities can deport you. In some circumstances, you can also be deported for shorter sentences. This is regardless of whether the judgement included deportation. If you are employed in Saudi Arabia this will impact your employment and may affect your ability to return to Saudi Arabia in the future.</p>\n\n",

Equipment is basic and often not sterile. You should carry basic medical supplies, and consider including an emergency dental kit if travelling outside Conakry. There are minimal facilities for dealing with heart problems and major trauma. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to Europe is necessary. There are some well-stocked pharmacies in Conakry but few outside the capital. You should ensure that medicine is genuine. Make sure you have adequate supplies of prescription medication, bearing in mind the risk of delays due to flight cancellations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ebola\">Ebola</h3>\n\n<p>On 19 June 2021 the Ministry of Health declared an end to the Ebola epidemic that had started in the Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9 sub-district of the N\u2019z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 region in February.

Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local French authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several high-profile terrorist attacks in France, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2021, a police officer was killed at a police station in Rambouillet</li>\n  <li>in 2020, 3 people were killed in a stabbing at the Notre-Dame de Nice in Nice</li>\n  <li>in 2020, one person was killed in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine</li>\n  <li>in 2020, 2 people were injured in a knife attack in central Paris</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"industrial-action-and-demonstrations\">Industrial action and demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>There can be frequent industrial action across France. This can lead to disruption and delays on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re due to travel to or within France, monitor the media, check your operator\u2019s advice and follow the advice of the authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions against street and car crime. Pickpockets can work in gangs; one distracts you while the other one goes into your bag. Don\u2019t leave your passport or other valuable items alone in vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Thieves and pickpockets operate on the Paris underground, RER lines and at mainline stations. Make sure you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>don\u2019t keep your passport, credit cards and other valuables in the same place</li>\n  <li>use the inside compartments in bags where possible</li>\n  <li>carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder</li>\n  <li>keep your belongings close to you in restaurants and bars</li>\n  <li>aren\u2019t distracted around tourist attractions and cash points</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your passport is lost or stolen, it is advisable to report this to the police and obtain a police report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"assault\">Assault</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several cases of serious assault on the RER (train) line B, which serves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Paris Charles de Gaulle airport</li>\n  <li>Orly airports</li>\n  <li>Paris Gare du Nord Eurostar terminus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have also been serious assaults on RER line D, which serves the Stade de France.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"be-drink-aware\">Be drink aware</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars abroad are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must be able to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1036?lang=en\">prove your identity</a> either by providing documents when asked or within 4 hours at a police station. Identity documents can be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passport</li>\n  <li>photo driving licence</li>\n  <li>other documentation provided by a government body</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"covering-your-face-in-public\">Covering your face in public</h3>\n\n<p>Covering your face in public places in France is illegal. This includes balaclavas, full veils or any other garment or mask that is used to hide the face. You can be fined up to \u20ac150 euros if you don\u2019t comply. Forcing someone to hide their face is also a crime and is punishable by a year\u2019s imprisonment and a fine of up to \u20ac30,000 euros. If the person forced to hide their face is under 18 years old, the sentence is doubled. This law applies to tourists.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Some beaches may have strong undercurrents known as riptides (ba\u00efnes), especially along the Atlantic Coast. Local sea conditions can be dangerous even for strong swimmers.</p>\n\n<p>Most beaches have lifeguards and flag warning systems. Make sure you understand the warning system before swimming and always follow the advice closely. Follow local advice if there are jellyfish in the sea.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of rip tides in some areas, particularly around the coast of Gironde and Landes. See further information on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gironde.gouv.fr/Politiques-publiques/Securite/Securite-sanitaire/Prevention-baignade-en-mer\">Gironde Prefecture French local authority website</a> (in French).</p>\n\n<p>See more information on safe swimming on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">ABTA\u2019s swim safe webpages</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking-winter-sports-and-mountaineering\">Trekking, winter sports and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you\u2019re properly prepared. Don\u2019t undertake any activity alone and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.</p>\n\n<p>For sporting activities, or travel to mountainous areas, make sure your insurance covers you for extra medical costs in case of accident or emergency, mountain rescue services and helicopter costs. In the d\u00e9partements of Savoie and Haute-Savoie, you may need to be transferred to Switzerland for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Read FCDO advice on how to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">stay safe on the slopes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in France, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/france/\">RAC France guide</a> .</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u202feither a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK driving licence\u202fto drive in France.

Sometimes migrants might try to slow down traffic on roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port road. If this happens, keep moving where it\u2019s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn\u2019t safe to proceed. Keep car doors locked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>France has strict drink driving laws. Police regularly carry out roadside checks for alcohol and drugs. Penalties include fines, loss of licence and prison. You can be given on-the-spot fines for a variety of driving offences, including speeding.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-pollution-sticker\">Air pollution sticker</h3>\n\n<p>All vehicles driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble must display a pollution sticker from 8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday. Checks can happen at any time, depending on pollution levels.</p>\n\n<p>Some older vehicles don\u2019t qualify for a sticker at all due to their high emissions.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"tribal-fighting\">Tribal Fighting</h2>\n\n<p>Outbreaks of tribal fighting are common across Papua New Guinea, especially in the settlement areas of Port Moresby and the Highlands provinces. Ethnic disputes can quickly escalate and lead to widespread destruction of property, disruption of normal services and serious injury. Stay alert, monitor local media and consult local contacts (accommodation or other service providers) before travelling to a new area. Tribal fighters and criminals in these areas may be armed. Although foreigners are not normally targeted, you should stay away from areas where tribal fighting is taking place.</p>\n\n<p>In July, the Enga Provincial Government declared a three-month daily curfew from 21:00 to 06:00 due to an escalation in tribal conflict. Travel and other restrictions may be imposed at short notice. You should take particular care throughout the province and stay away from \u00a0the area around the Porgera gold mine (currently closed), which has been subject to violent landowner disputes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Serious crime is high in the capital, Port Moresby, and in the cities of Lae and Mt Hagen. Settlement or squatter areas of towns and cities are particularly dangerous. \u2018Bush knives\u2019 (machetes) and firearms are often used in assaults and thefts. Carjacking, assault (including sexual assaults), bag snatching and robberies are common. Banks and cash machines are attractive targets for criminals. Walking after dark is particularly dangerous in Port Moresby and other urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>Known high-risk crime areas include the area around Parliament House in the Port Moresby suburb of Waigani, particularly outside of working hours, and along the highway between Lae and Nadzab Airport. Criminals use roadblocks outside towns to stop and loot vehicles and then attack the occupants.</p>\n\n<p>Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for possible new security risks. If you intend to travel in these areas, particularly after dark, take great care and consider travelling in convoy or using a security escort. Always lock car doors and keep windows up.</p>\n\n<p>There have been serious attacks and robberies along the Kokoda Track. Although community leaders have assured tourists of their safety and well-being while walking the Kokoda Track, you should take care. Avoid walking independently and travel with guides from trusted \u00a0travel companies. You can get details from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.papuanewguinea.travel/\">Papua New Guinea Tourism Authority</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kokodatrackauthority.org/\">Kokoda Track Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is random, but people have been aducted by organised gangs and forced to open office safes while others are held captive until a ransom has been paid.  A foreign national was kidnapped in a remote part of Southern Highlands in February 2023. Risk of violent crime, rape and sexual assault in Papua New Guinea is high. In general:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not\u00a0carry large amounts of cash or openly display expensive jewellery and electronic equipment</li>\n  <li>be vigilant at all times and leave travel plans with friends, relatives or reliable local contacts\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Check your travel insurance before considering any travel to remote areas. The cost of rescue by boat or aircraft can be high.</p>\n\n<p>Damage caused by heavy rain and cyclones can make travel difficult.</p>\n\n<p>World War II unexploded ordnance still exists in Papua New Guinea, particularly along the Kokoda Track, at Milne Bay and Rabaul.</p>\n\n<p>Bougainville Island has previously seen a periods of separatist conflict, but has been calm since a peace agreement was signed in 2001. You should still be vigilant when travelling in Bougainville, particularly in central and southern Bougainville. The mountainous area in central Bougainville around the old Panguna mine is designated a \u2018No Go Zone\u2019, which you should not enter without prior authorisation from the Mekamui who control the border/check point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h2>\n\n<p>The land boundary between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea stretches for around 760km and is poorly defined. There are occasionally clashes along the border between the Indonesian military and the OPM (Organisasi Papua Merdeka \u2013 Free Papua Movement).</p>\n\n<p>The Papua New Guinea Government has defence units at its Wutung border post in Sandaun province. You should take extreme care and be prepared for possible sudden closure of the border crossing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Given the challenging terrain, extreme weather conditions and the condition of some remote airfields, flying in Papua New Guinea carries greater safety risks than flying in the UK. Since 2000, over 20 aircraft accidents have happened in Papua New Guinea. The worst recent crash was on 13 April 2016 when a Sunbird Aviation PNG Britten-Norman Islander aircraft crashed at Kiunga Airport in Western province, killing all 12 people on board.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is the only way to travel between Port Moresby and other provinces.  Delays and cancellations of international and domestic flights occur regularly. Check with your airline before travel and be prepared for the possibility of a lengthy wait at the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Driving is on the left. When driving, you must keep your driving licence with you at all times. You may use your UK driving licence for up to one month. Roads, especially in rural areas, are in a poor state of repair and driving is often erratic. Drivers who are involved in, or witness road accidents may find themselves at personal risk. You should seek police assistance as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use public buses known locally as PMVs. There have been incidents of armed hold-ups of PMVs and of passengers being attacked and robbed of their personal belongings. There have also been reports of occasional rape attacks on Port Moresby PMVs. Many PMVs are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are available in some major centres, but can be badly maintained. If you use a taxi, agree a fare before setting off, irrespective of whether or not there is a meter. Where possible arrange to be met by family, friends or a hotel courtesy bus when arriving at international or domestic airports.</p>\n",

Protests sometimes take place in central Yerevan and other major cities.

Although protests tend to be peaceful and usually pass off without incident, you should avoid large crowds and demonstrations, follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities, monitor the media and remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>The border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed. There have been many instances of military clashes across the border during the last 12 months, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties.

But there are occasional incidents of pick pocketing, bag snatching, theft from cars and burglary involving British or other foreign nationals. Although tourists and foreigners have not been targeted, there is a risk of being caught up in such events and you should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>don\u2019t carry your passport, credit card, travel tickets and money together.</li>\n  <li>leave spare cash, passports and valuables in a safe place.

British consular officials can\u2019t give you money to help you return home. You can transfer money from the UK using many of the commercial money transfer agencies in Yerevan, including MoneyGram. You can also use most major credit and debit cards to obtain money from <abbr title=\"Automated Telling Machines\">ATMs</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 5km of the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and along the M16/H26 road between the towns of Ijevan and Noyemberyan.</p>\n\n<p>The border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed. There have been frequent violations of historical ceasefires between these countries from military emplacements along the border. There have been periods of increased tension which can make the security situation in border regions unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>The land border with Turkey is also closed, although there are scheduled direct flights between Yerevan and Istanbul.</p>\n\n<p>Travelling in the South Caucasus can be unpredictable and infrastructure is sometimes in a poor state of repair. You should plan your travel carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Armenia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The local standard of driving is poor. Be prepared for drivers who drive recklessly and flout traffic laws. Roads are in a poor state, particularly in the coldest months (November to February). If possible you should avoid driving outside of cities and towns in the dark because of the poor condition of the roads and lack of street lighting. If you are walking, be careful when crossing roads and use subways where available.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using local buses or minibuses as they are often poorly maintained and  overcrowded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Public transport is often overcrowded and poorly maintained. If you have to travel by train, secure your valuables, do not leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Armenia can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EK\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a list of airlines banned from operating within the EU on the\u00a0 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">European Commission website</a>. The list is based on random inspections on aircraft of airlines that operate flights to and from EU airports. The fact that an airline is not included in the list does not automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved. Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Although a ceasefire exists, the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed.</p>\n\n<p>Russian peacekeepers have been deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh, but tensions remain.  The border areas between Armenia and Azerbaijan also contain mines and unexploded ordnance. Any foreigners venturing within 5km of these borders are liable to be stopped by the police or the military.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"telephone-and-internet-communications\">Telephone and internet communications</h3>\n\n<p>Communication by telephone and e-mail can sometimes be difficult especially in the regions. Not all British mobile phones work in Armenia; check for coverage before leaving the UK if you intend to rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Access to wifi in cafes and restaurants in Yerevan is generally widespread. Outside major cities access to wifi in public places is not guaranteed. Most hotels offer a wifi service but it can sometimes be unreliable. Make sure family and friends who expect regular contact are aware of this to avoid unnecessary worry.</p>\n\n",

Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in some parts of Armenia, including Mount Aragats which is 4,090m and the lakes of Aragats which lie at around 3,000m above sea level. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"healthcare\">Healthcare</h3>\n<p>The reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Armenia terminated on 1 January 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Medical facilities are generally poor, particularly outside Yerevan, and treatment is not recommended for anything other than minor or straightforward ailments. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Take great care when travelling by road, including by public transport, and when crossing streets. Cycle rickshaws are not safe \u2013 they offer little protection if there is an accident.</p>\n\n<p>Ride hailing apps like Uber are available in Bangladesh.

The Bangladesh Civil Aviation Ministry has completed its investigation into the incident.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

This can also cover prescription and non-prescription medicines commonly available in the UK.

Outside major towns, you may not find ATMs or be able to use credit and debit cards.

Homophobic harassment and assault take place.</p>\n\n<p>Pride marches in 2019 and 2021 were cancelled because the police did not guarantee security.

Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process</li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Georgian and\u00a0UK\u00a0laws before making any arrangements</li>\n  <li>read\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0and Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>\n</li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Georgia to the\u00a0UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need a Georgian birth certificate for this. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://psh.gov.ge/main/menus/1\">Public Service Hall</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sda.gov.ge/?page_id=7313&amp;lang=en\">Service Development Agency</a> websites and research the rules for leaving the country with children (some legal details are in Georgian only). You can stay visa-free in Georgia for a continuous period of up to one year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://new.geoconsul.gov.ge/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia</a> has more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trade-with-south-ossetia-and-abkhazia\">Trade with South Ossetia and Abkhazia</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia needs a licence issued by the Georgia government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Anyone trading without a licence may face penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> covers your activities.</p>\n\n<p>If you get into trouble during hiking, skiing, adventure travel or extreme sports, the emergency response may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is very dangerous. It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks. Read our information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">staying safe during skiing and winter sports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re trekking, mountaineering, climbing, off-piste skiing or doing other extreme sports, consider going with specialist guides. Many insurance policies will not cover damage to rental equipment or skiing off-piste without a guide.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that safety standards in Georgia may not be as high as those in the UK. For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to hike close to the administrative boundary lines, consider hiring a professional guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas.</p>\n\n<p>Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven. There may be occasional short power cuts \u2013 consider carrying a torch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly. To stay safe using taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not flag taxis in the street</li>\n  <li>try to pre-book taxis through an app</li>\n  <li>check the taxi has working seatbelts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Georgia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/georgia/\">RAC Georgia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Georgia with a UK driving licence for up to one year (from when you last entered Georgia). To drive for longer, you need a 1949 or 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dds.georgia.gov/drivers-other-nations\">Georgian driving licence</a>. If you\u2019re hiring a car, check the rules with the car hire company before you travel. They may require you to have an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Drink driving punishments can be severe. Georgia has a lower blood alcohol content limit than the UK, so avoid alcohol if driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when driving, especially at night. Be aware that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>roads outside city centres are often badly lit and poor quality</li>\n  <li>stray livestock can be a hazard</li>\n  <li>road markings and the right of way can be confusing</li>\n  <li>many cars are poorly maintained</li>\n  <li>driving can be erratic</li>\n  <li>heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas)</li>\n  <li>landslides are common</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling outside Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is equipped and check weather conditions locally.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions with your personal safety and belongings. Compartments on sleeper trains usually have locks.</p>\n\n<p>There is currently no train service between Azerbaijan and Georgia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>There are frequent small earthquakes in Georgia. The most recent significant earthquake took place in 2022 \u2013 an earthquake measuring 6.2 struck 104km south-west of Tbilisi. Read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency advice on what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lightning and wildfires are a risk in summer, particularly in the mountains.</p>\n\n",

You could be fined 25 to 100 US dollars if you\u2019re caught smoking where it\u2019s not allowed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. You can get a prison sentence for possessing even a small quantity of drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The judicial process is slow and sentencing may take up to 2 years. Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Panama are harsh. Most facilities are overcrowded with limited access to healthcare. There have been recent cases of riots ending in prisoner deaths.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex civil unions are illegal, but same-sex relationships are legal in Panama. Most Panamanians are generally tolerant of LGBT+ travellers. However, Panamanian law does not ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There have been incidents of police officers detaining LGBT+ couples on the grounds of public indecency. Showing affection in public can lead to unwanted attention. Casco Viejo is considered a safe place for LGBT+ travellers.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when wading, swimming or taking part in water sports on Pacific and Caribbean beaches. Some beaches have strong currents and undertows and there are rarely warning signs. People drown every year.</p>\n\n<p>Do not swim in the Bay of Panama as it is highly polluted with untreated sewage and industrial waste.</p>\n\n<p>See advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">safe swimming from ABTA</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">holiday water safety from the Royal Life Saving Society</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>Only hike in the hills around Boquete and the Province of Chiriqui with an experienced guide. Trails may not be well marked, and mobile phone coverage is unreliable. Do not go hiking without taking necessary precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning on driving, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Panama for up to 3 months. The Panamanian authorities will not accept a paper licence \u2013 you can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a>. Carry a copy of your passport with the dated entry stamp as proof you\u2019re still within the 3 months permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers and front-seat passengers must wear seatbelts. Children aged 4 and under must travel in the back in fitted child seats.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Panama. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine, have your licence revoked and your car impounded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards can be poor. Traffic accidents are common. Roads are often poorly lit and can have potholes and unfinished repairs. Darien Province and other remote rural areas may have very few surfaced roads.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic is very heavy in Panama City and other populated areas such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Pacora</li>\n  <li>Chorrera</li>\n  <li>Capira</li>\n  <li>Arraijan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Repair work and construction sites are common in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a traffic accident with another driver, wait inside your vehicle for your insurance representative and the transit police to arrive. Avoid any type of confrontation with other drivers or passers-by.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Unregistered taxis can be in poor condition. Many accidents are due to poor maintenance and driving standards. Picking up many passengers is common in Panama. Make sure your drivers do not do this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. Hurricanes do not directly affect Panama but often cause heavy rain. There may be flash floods and landslides. October and November have the heaviest rainfall. Monitor local news, check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/country.html?countryCode=76\">World Meteorological Association weather reports for Panama</a> and follow local advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in Panama.

There have been a few cases of individuals being drugged and robbed on public transport and in bars. Don\u2019t accept food and drink from strangers. Foreign visitors and residents may be targeted by scam artists. Be wary of strangers approaching you or your accommodation or contacting you by phone asking for personal information or financial help. There are regular reports of criminal kidnaps, these very rarely target foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t carry large sums of cash or wear expensive looking jewellery or watches. Take particular care of your passport. Take extra care when going out on foot and avoid walking after dark wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Keep car doors locked and windows shut when driving in towns. There have been a number of thefts from cars and taxis while stationary in traffic. Don\u2019t leave valuables in vehicles. If you are stopped by armed criminals, don\u2019t resist.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can occur without warning, causing loss of life and injury, anywhere in Uganda. Incidents are more likely around elections. The police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. You should take great care and avoid all demonstrations and rallies where possible.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2020, there were election-related protests in Kampala and other locations across Uganda, with incidents of violence and a number of deaths. Country-wide internet shut-downs have been implemented around elections, other political events and during protests. Disruption to social media sites (e.g. Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp) have also taken place in Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>Certain colours; for example red and yellow, are strongly associated with political parties in Uganda. You should be cautious about wearing these colours in public.</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself caught up in a political demonstration, remain calm and try to move away from the area by the safest possible route. If you\u2019re travelling in a vehicle, ensure that the doors are locked and windows are up. If you\u2019re in your accommodation and there\u2019s a demonstration nearby, remain inside if you judge that leaving your accommodation is threatening or unsafe. Familiarise yourself with the security procedures in place at your accommodation, and make sure appropriate precautions are deployed as necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel--north-east-uganda\">Local travel\u00a0- north-east Uganda</h3>\n\n<p>There is an ongoing military operation in northeast Uganda in the Karamoja sub-region (districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Abim, Moroto and Nakapiripirit) against armed cattle theft and intercommunal violence. Military and civilians have been killed during the operation.  Armed raids to steal cattle have also been reported in districts that neighbour Karamoja in the Teso and Acholi sub-regions. Foreigners are not usually the target of attacks but you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and, like in the rest of Uganda, avoid any travel at night.</p>\n\n<p>The north east is particularly susceptible to flooding during the rainy season (from March to May and October to November).  Monitor local media and take care in all remote areas including the use of suitably equipped 4 wheel drive vehicles.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel---northern-and-western-uganda\">Local travel - northern and western Uganda</h3>\n\n<p>Take great care near the border with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-congo\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan\">South Sudan</a>. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border Uganda and against all travel to South Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>Uganda and DRC began joint military action against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of eastern DRC, near to parts of the Ugandan border, on 30 November 2021. Ugandan troops are present on both sides of the border as part of the joint operations.</p>\n\n<p>This operation  may affect the function of some border crossing points which could close at short notice. There is also a risk of banditry. If you are in these areas you should be vigilant and keep your security situation under constant review.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel---west-uganda\">Local travel - west Uganda</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of incidents of violent clashes in western Uganda, particularly the Kasese area, in recent years. On 17 October there was an attack in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Western Uganda resulting in three fatalities. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all but essential travel to Queen Elizabeth National Park, and the area immediately southwest of Kasese.\u00a0This area starts at the border with DRC at Kyabikere and south to Katojo along the border, and extends eastwards from those points up to and including the A109 road. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> also advises against all but essential travel to Semuliki National Park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel---south-west-uganda\">Local travel - south west Uganda</h3>\n<p>The parts of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-congo\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> immediately neighbouring southwest Uganda have a history of instability and violent conflict can flare up with little notice. Take care when travelling in the area. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>On 27 October 2022 there was renewed fighting between Democratic Republic of Congo government forces and the armed group M23 in the Democratic Republic of Congo very close to the Ugandan border. Both the Bunagana border crossing and the Kitagoma/Buszana border crossing in Kisoro district are controlled by the M23 armed group on the Democratic Republic of Congo side of the border. If you are in this area you should be vigilant and keep your security situation under constant review. There were previous clashes on 12 June 2022, 23 May 2022 and 29 March 2022 and border crossing points were temporarily suspended. They could be closed again at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>On 2 April 2019 a foreign national and a Ugandan national were kidnapped from the Ishasha section of Queen Elizabeth National Park which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo. Both were released 7 April 2019.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel--eastern-uganda\">Local travel\u00a0- eastern Uganda</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"fcdo-advises-against-all-but-essential-travel-to-jinja-town-except-travelling-through-jinja-town-on-the-a109\">\n<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to Jinja Town, except travelling through Jinja Town on the A109.</h3>\n\n<p>Travel to eastern Uganda is largely trouble free, but during heavy rains there is a risk of landslides particularly in Bulucheke sub-county in Bududa District near Mount Elgon National Park, a popular tourist destination.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel---national-parks\">Local travel - National Parks</h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all but essential travel to Queen Elizabeth National Park and Semuliki National Park.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable, registered tour operators and contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ugandawildlife.org/\">Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA)</a> for up to date advice and information before you travel. Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks are in the extreme south west of Uganda near the border with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-congo\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda\">Rwanda</a>. It\u2019s routine practice for security personnel to accompany tourists on gorilla-tracking visits in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Some gorilla trekking operators cross into the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-congo/\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>. You should avoid taking these tours. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border Uganda, this includes Virunga National Park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Uganda using a UK driving licence for up to 3 months, after which you will need to get a Ugandan driving licence from the Uganda Revenue Authority or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Travelling by road can be hazardous, particularly outside the main cities. Driving standards are poor, vehicles are often poorly maintained and the accident rate is high. Other road users may be driving without lights and livestock roam across the roads. The Jinja\u00a0- Kampala and the Kampala\u00a0- Masaka roads are particular accident black spots.</p>\n\n<p>Speed limits in built-up areas are generally 50km/h and out of town 80km/h. The police enforce this law and breaking speed limits can result in a fine, imprisonment or both.</p>\n\n<p>For reasons of road safety and security you should avoid travelling outside of the main towns after dark, except on the roads between Kampala and Entebbe International Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your vehicle is in good condition and stocked with items you might need in case of a breakdown or other incidents.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving Ugandan long distance bus services, linking Kampala with other towns in Uganda and internationally with Nairobi, Kigali and Dar es Salaam. Some overnight buses have been robbed after being forced to stop by roadblocks or by criminals posing as passengers.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid using matatus (minibus taxis following a particular route) and boda-bodas (motorbike taxis). Though cheap, matatus and boda-bodas don\u2019t meet western safety standards, are generally in poor condition, badly driven and often don\u2019t have proper insurance cover. Accidents are common, and can be fatal. There have been recent incidents of foreign nationals being mugged whilst using boda-bodas, some of which have involved violence and the use of weapons.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boattravel\">Boat\u00a0Travel</h3>\n\n<p>Large numbers of ferry passengers have died in accidents on Lakes Albert and Victoria in recent years often due to overloading of passengers and goods.</p>\n\n<p>Use a reputable ferry company and if you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unseaworthy, don\u2019t get on. Familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"contacting-the-british-high-commission\">Contacting the British High Commission</h3>\n\n<p>You can keep up to date with travel advice by subscribing to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/email-signup\">email alerts</a>.

If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms you may be required to take a COVID-19 test.

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page.

Medical help at the scene of an accident is likely to be limited, particularly outside of Kampala, and many popular tourist attractions are far from adequate medical facilities. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Make sure you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">adequate travel health insurance</a> and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>On 21 March 2023 Tanzanian health authorities confirmed an outbreak of Marburg disease in Bukoba, in the Kagera region of northwest Tanzania.

Street crime is also increasing and you should avoid making yourself an easy target, especially at night. There have been a number of attacks on tourists at nightclubs and bars in Port Vila. Check with the Vanuatu Tourist Office or your hotel on places where extra caution is required.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several serious attacks on foreigners, including lone women, in isolated locations. Avoid visiting remote tourist sites or beaches alone. Where possible, travel as part of a larger group.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Before you travel, make copies of your passport and travel documents.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.

These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider. All travellers must complete the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://healthapp.ncdc.gov.ng/\">online Nigeria Health Declaration Form</a> before travelling to Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Around 117,000 British tourists visit Nigeria every year. Most visits are trouble-free, but a small number of British people encounter problems. You should take sensible precautions to protect your safety.</p>\n\n<p>The Nigeria-Niger land border has been closed and commercial flights between Nigeria and Niger have been prohibited by the Nigerian authorities, in response to the political situation in Niger. Flight times between Nigeria and other neighbouring countries may also be affected. See Local Travel.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Nigeria. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>. Most attacks occur in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States in the North East. There have also been significant attacks in other states, including in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Bauchi, Taraba, Kogi, Niger, and the Federal Capital Territory. Further attacks are likely and could occur at any time. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could affect western interests as well as places visited by tourists. Attacks are more likely to attack crowded locations or symbolic targets, such as places of worship. There is a heightened risk during religious events, public holidays or election periods.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of criminal and terrorist kidnap throughout Nigeria. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism#terrorist-kidnaps\">Terrorist kidnaps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/safety-and-security#criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of banditry and inter-communal violence occur frequently throughout Nigeria. Attacks can occur without warning.

International news events can sometimes trigger anti-Western demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays. See more information under \u2018<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/safety-and-security#protests-demonstrations-and-intercommunal-violence\">Protests and Demonstrations\u2019</a></p>\n\n<p>Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings, car-jackings and armed robbery in Nigeria. You should be vigilant at all times. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a>.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Nigeria as having a risk of Zika virus, Cholera, Lassa fever, Yellow fever, Monkey pox, Poliomyelitis and Ebola virus transmission. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/health\">Health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before considering travel to areas to which the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all or all but essential travel you should take professional security advice. Be vigilant at all times and keep others informed of your travel plans. If you\u2019re working in Nigeria you should follow your employer\u2019s security advice, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly. Consular support is offered in Nigeria although limited in areas where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n",

Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for attacks, including an attack on Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital during which an unknown number of prisoners escaped, including suspected terrorists.

Incidents of inter-communal violence occur and trains are vulnerable to attack.

Humanitarian personnel, vehicles, supplies and infrastructure can be targeted by terrorists and criminals. For recent attacks, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">see Terrorism</a>. Further attacks may occur without warning.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnap, violent attacks and inter-communal tensions which can lead to outbreaks of violence. During the dry season (which normally runs from around October to March) this risk is likely to be heightened.</p>\n\n<p>Regular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. There is a risk of retaliatory attacks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the North East against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date. If you are working, you should be fully confident in your employer\u2019s ability to extract you in the event of any emergency. If in Maiduguri you should be aware that if security were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nigeria-borders\">Nigeria borders</h3>\n\n<p>The Nigeria-Niger land border has been closed by the Nigerian authorities in response to the political situation in Niger. Additional checks are in place at the Nigeria-Benin, Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Cameroon land borders. If you\u2019re planning to make a land crossing from Nigeria, check with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-demonstrations-and-intercommunal-violence\">Protests, demonstrations and intercommunal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can occur with little notice throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and take local advice on areas to avoid. Take particular care if you\u2019re visiting crowded public places or attending events which attract large crowds. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don\u2019t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of inter-communal violence occur frequently throughout Nigeria. Attacks can occur without warning. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of terrorist and criminal kidnaps in Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time, with an increased risk in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the northern and middle belt states of Adamawa,  Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Nassarawa, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba, Benue, Yobe and Zamfara</li>\n  <li>the Niger Delta states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Imo and Rivers</li>\n  <li>Edo State</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminal groups target whole communities or individuals. Kidnaps are sometimes take place along major highways, such as the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna highway and Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway in Anambra.</p>\n\n<p>On 16 May 2023 a US diplomatic convoy was attacked and people were kidnapped in Anambra State in the Ogbaru area, close to Delta state. The incident is under investigation.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping and other armed attacks targeting oil and gas facilities and workers in the Niger Delta region. This also applies to facilities at sea.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers wishing to travel to any of the locations above should be alert to the threat of kidnap, and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting.</p>\n\n<p>The great majority of kidnapping victims remain ordinary Nigerians. Foreigners as well as Nigerian businessmen, traditional rulers and politicians are often targeted in the expectation of a high ransom reward. When arranging meetings in Nigeria make sure those who attend are known to you and hold the meeting at a secure location.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals may be targeted. Foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped in the past, and in some cases killed.  British nationals of Nigerian origin visiting friends and relatives are often perceived as being wealthier than locals and are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. There is a possibility that criminal groups would sell hostages on to terrorist organisations. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"curfews-and-telecommunication-blackouts\">Curfews and telecommunication blackouts</h2>\n\n<p>Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to comply with all curfews and movement restrictions could put you at significant risk. You should check with the local authorities or someone with local knowledge for up to date information on curfews and restrictions before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Telecommunication operators in Nigeria have in the past been ordered to suspend services in certain areas, including mobile telecommunications and WiFi. Future shutdowns may happen at short notice and may also be extended to new areas without advanced notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maritime-security\">Maritime security</h2>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies and incidents of piracy in Nigerian waters, the wider Gulf of Guinea, and on the rivers and harbours in the Niger Delta area. Mariners should seek professional security advice, be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robbery.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals as their perceived wealth makes them an attractive victim.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends and family, follow the security guidance offered by employers or hosts and limit road travel at night as far as possible. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don\u2019t wear valuable watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value. If you suspect danger, move to a safer area.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re caught up in an armed robbery, you should immediately comply with the attackers\u2019 demands.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities.  Scams can pose great financial risk to victims. You should be very cautious about any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. You can read more about scam or \u2018419\u2019 emails and letters on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud-az-419\">Action Fraud website.</a></p>\n\n<p>If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Nigeria you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>People have received scam e-mails claiming to be from a British High Commission office in Nigeria. If you receive an email that appears to be from any British High Commission office in Nigeria asking for bank details or money, you should immediately contact the Consular Section of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-abuja#contact-us\">British Deputy High Commission</a> in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering fertility treatment in Nigeria, you should be cautious. There have been a number of staged fake births (commonly called \u2018miracle babies\u2019) which result in visitors being falsely led to believe they have given birth. You should be aware of the risks associated with bringing a child who is not biologically related to you into the UK without following appropriate legal procedures. The UK has restricted <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-adoption/adopting-a-child-from-overseas\">overseas adoption of children</a> from Nigeria.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Road travel across Nigeria can be chaotic and slow moving. You should take a mobile telephone and a supply of bottled water with you when travelling by car.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Nigeria with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer, you will need to get a Nigerian Driver\u2019s Licence. You can contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nigeriadriverslicence.org/\">Federal Road Safety Corp</a> on their website.</p>\n\n<p>You should limit travel after dark outside city centres as far as possible; and avoid quiet and poorly lit roads. You should be particularly vigilant when sitting in traffic jams or at traffic lights. Keep car windows up and doors locked, and make sure valuables are out of sight. If you feel your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest place of safety (eg the nearest police station).</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care when driving outside cities and consider travelling in convoy and avoid travel after dark.</p>\n\n<p>In Lagos, eating, smoking or using a mobile phone while driving and riding a motorcycle without a helmet are prohibited. Motorists face fines or imprisonment for violations.</p>\n\n<p>There are authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. You should slow down at any type of checkpoint and use common sense at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in Northern Nigeria. This includes attacks on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent reports of robberies and car-jackings, some involving armed gunmen, on Nigeria\u2019s urban and rural road network.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport throughout Nigeria is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Most major hotels offer cars for hire with drivers. You should use these where possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you are expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at any of Nigeria\u2019s international airports, make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. Bogus greeters are a problem.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Commercial flights between Nigeria and Niger have been prohibited by the Nigerian authorities in response to the political situation in Niger. If you\u2019re planning to travel to or from Niger, check the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s Niger travel page or with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling.

These lists aren\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Med-View airline has been <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1277_en.htm\">refused permission to operate services to the EU</a>  due to safety deficiencies.

You can find a full list of airlines banned from operating within the EU on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban_en\">European Commission website</a>. Refusal of permission to operate is often based on inspections of aircraft at EU airports. The fact that an airline isn\u2019t included in the list doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards. British government employees travelling within Nigeria have been advised to use carriers that aren\u2019t subject to the EU operating ban.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Swimming off the coast of Nigeria is dangerous due to rip tides and undertows, drownings occur each year.

There have also been significant attacks in other states, including in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Bauchi and Taraba States.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of terrorism across Nigeria includes the capital city Abuja, and the surrounding Federal Capital Territory area. This risk has increased in 2022. Since May 2022 Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) have conducted a number of attacks in Kogi, Niger, and in the Federal Capital Territory. The risk is present across the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja, and particularly in the border areas of the Federal Capital Territory.</p>\n\n<p>Public places where crowds gather have been targeted in the past, including places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, football viewing centres, displacement camps, transport terminals (including train networks), government buildings, security and educational institutions (schools, further education colleges and universities are all regular targets), and international organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included coordinated armed assaults, rocket attacks, assassinations, kidnapping, use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), bombings (including by child and female bombers), car bombings and arson. Use of military uniforms and vehicles have been used as a tactic to get close to the intended target.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have been known to construct illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes, such as the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road.</p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian staff and assets, civilians and aid workers have been targeted, especially in the North East, including in garrison towns and on roads. Humanitarian sites have also been targeted.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid places where there are political or other large public gatherings. Be vigilant, remain alert and pay attention to your surroundings at all times. You should follow local news reports and be alert to developments particularly around religious and public holidays.

Several foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been kidnapped in the north of Nigeria, including in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Katsina, Kano and Kebbi. Some victims of kidnap, including two British nationals, have been killed by their captors. There may be an increased risk of kidnap, particularly to NGO workers, in Gwoza and Bama local government areas, Borno State. ISWA has also targeted foreigners for kidnap in south Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism, government or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise vigilance when travelling, when in crowded public places, including religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, transport hubs and camps for displaced people.
