There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in areas of Cabo Delgado province dating back to January 2019. There was a large-scale attack on Palma in March/April 2021 in which dozens of people were killed. Since May/June 2022 there has been a series of attacks in the Ancuabe,Metuge and Chiure districts of Cabo Delgado and in the Memba and Erati districts of Nampula province just to the south. Although there have been no recent reports of attacks in the Mecula, Mavago and Marrupa districts of Niassa Province, you should remain vigilant in these areas, as the situation may change with no prior warning. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. Attacks have been carried out on the mainland and on islands off the coast, including in areas frequented by foreigners. There is an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. There is also a threat of kidnap in Mozambique, which is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Coastal areas are at risk from tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi, Licungo, Pungue, Buzi, Limpopo and Save. The rainy season (November to April) will also make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable.</p>\n\n<p>There continues to be a risk of cyclone and tropical storm weather systems during the rainy season (November to April). These may lead to widespread damage to infrastructure as well as disruption to basic services including communications, power and water supplies.</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inam.gov.mz/\">National Meterological Institute</a>\u00a0(in Portuguese) for the latest information and follow instructions from the local authorities.

You should take extra care. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you\u2019re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates.

The office which issues driving licences has now reopened. It is an offence not to carry your driving licence with you when driving. Be ready to present original car documentation when requested by the police.</p>\n\n<p>Third party insurance cover is compulsory. You can buy this at most land borders. You should carry two reflective triangles and a reflective vest in your vehicle at all times. You must wear the reflective vest when repairing, loading or unloading a vehicle. Police officers sometimes attempt to extract bribes from tourists. Don\u2019t pay a bribe to anyone. If you are stopped by the police, ask for a clear explanation of the offence and a written fine that can be paid at a police station.</p>\n\n<p>Only travel by road outside Maputo and other major cities during daylight. Where possible, keep to major roads and travel in convoy in rural areas. Fuel is often only available in larger towns.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of carjacking, particularly in Maputo but also between Boane and the Swaziland border crossing points of Namaacha and Goba. Keep your car doors locked while driving. Be particularly vigilant when arriving at or leaving residential properties after dark. Avoid driving alone at night.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t pick up strangers or stop to help distressed motorists or pedestrians. Hijackers sometimes use these techniques to trick motorists into stopping their vehicle.

Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.

You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020 the Sudanese authorities amended the law on alcohol to allow consumption by non-Muslims, but not in the company of Muslims. In practice, non-Muslims drinking alcohol may face arrest regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Non-Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads, but should dress modestly and respect local customs and sensitivities.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual practices and extra marital relations are illegal and subject to severe penalties. This includes inviting guests into hotel rooms. Sudanese society is not tolerant of homosexual relationships. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBTQ+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry photo ID with you at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>All photography requires a formal permit. Don\u2019t take photographs or use a mobile phone camera close to government buildings, military installations, public utilities (including petrol stations), and other sensitive areas (bridges, airports etc.). Many plain clothed public security officers operate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h3>\n\n<p>Hotels will often take a photocopy of your passport. It\u2019s against the law to live together, or to share the same hotel room, with someone of the opposite sex to whom you aren\u2019t married or closely related.  Business meetings should take place in lobbies or business meetings room and not hotel rooms. British nationals have encountered problems in this respect with the Sudanese authorities. Tourist police patrol the hotels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property\">Buying property</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to buy property in Sudan, you should seek appropriate professional advice, as you would in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crime\">Financial crime</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud, bouncing cheques (including post-dated and \u2018security cheques\u2019) and the non-payment of bills (including hotel bills) can often result in imprisonment and/or a fine. Bank accounts and other assets can also be frozen.</p>\n\n<p>Bail is generally not available to people who are arrested for financial crimes. Those convicted will not usually be released from jail until the debt is paid or waived and they may even remain in jail after a debt has been paid if there is an outstanding sentence to be served.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-equipment\">Technical equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Equipment like satellite phones, listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras or binoculars may require a licence for use in Sudan. You should seek advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sudanembassy.org.uk/\">Sudanese Embassy in London</a> before travelling.</p>\n",

Formally, children travelling without their father will need a letter clearly providing consent for the child to enter and exit Sudan, though this is not always enforced. The letter should be stamped at the Sudanese Embassy before travel.</p>\n\n<p>Where the father is absent or deceased, mothers or guardians should get a court order which clearly shows that the mother or guardian has sole custodial rights for the children. Where the parents are divorced, this should be accompanied by divorce documents. Where the father is deceased, this should be accompanied by a death certificate.

The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>You should register with the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior within 3 days of your arrival in the country. You will need 2 passport size photos. The fee is the Sudanese Pound equivalent of around \u00a335. If you don\u2019t register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some of the larger hotels will do this for you but you should ask when you check-in.</p>\n\n<p>Formally, visitors to Sudan on a single entry visa need to get an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. Exit visas can be processed at the airport. If requested, you should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee of 50 US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Most foreign residents, including British nationals, also need an exit permit. You should check the details with your sponsor, before your arrival, to ensure that you understand and are happy with the process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-israel\">Previous travel to Israel</h3>\n<p>If your passport has an Israeli visa or Israeli entry or exit stamps you will not be allowed to enter Sudan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n<p>Check if you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/212/sudan#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n",

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizens Advice website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>. Versions prior to 2 September 2020 will be archived as FCO travel advice.

An area around the volcano, containing about two-thirds of the island, is vulnerable to volcanic hazard and is a no-go area. In addition there are three areas around the coastline which are designated Maritime Exclusion Zones where no shipping should enter. Seek local advice about safety precautions and access restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>A volcanic <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mvo.ms\">Hazard Level System</a> was introduced in 2014 for the Exclusion Zone. It rates the Level of Volcanic activity on a scale from 0-5; where 5 is the highest.  This part of the island is divided into five zones A, B, C, F and V and two maritime zones E and W and permission to enter these zones depends on the level of volcanic activity. The current Hazard Level is 1 and allows unlimited access to Zones A, B, C and F. Permission is required for access to Zone V. At this level the maritime zones E and W can only be transited during daylight hours and no anchorage is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Around 40% of the island is unaffected by volcanic activity but these areas may be prone to ash falls and volcanic gases during any volcanic activity and if the wind is blowing from south to north. These sometimes cause cancellation of flights to and from the island. The volcanic situation is monitored 24/7 by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/west.indies/soufriere/govt/miscdocs/mvo.html\">Montserrat Volcano Observatory</a> and the situation remains under constant review.</p>\n\n<p>An island-wide siren system is installed to warn of volcanic activity. The sirens are tested daily at 12:00 midday. If the sirens sound outside this, tune to Radio Montserrat (ZJB) immediately on FM 88.3 or 95.5 for an accompanying message. The radio station also provides regular scientific updates and advice to listeners. Brochures outlining the Hazard Level System are available at ports of entry to the island.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"maritime-exclusion-zone\">Maritime Exclusion Zone</h3>\n<p>There are three areas around Montserrat\u2019s coastlines designated as Maritime Exclusion Zones. Shipping should not enter these zones. The largest of these extends for 4km on the eastern side of the island and there are two on the western side of the island. The most southerly of the two extends for 2km off shore and the third for a half kilometre off shore. Maps showing these zones along with their GPS co-ordinates are available to mariners at the Montserrat Port Authority at Port Little Bay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n<p>The hurricane season in the Caribbean officially runs from 1 June to 30 November, though very stormy weather can occur outside this period.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://severe.worldweather.org/\">World Meteorological Organisation</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">US National Hurricane Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">tropical cyclone.</a></p>\n\n",

However, you should take care if you intend to travel to Jahra, where there have been incidents involving firearms, or Jleeb Al Shuyoukh, where there have been instances of robbery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>You should only use authorised land border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Border posts can be easily missed on the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian border, but you must get an exit or entry stamp before continuing your journey. Any unauthorised movement near borders is illegal and dangerous, with armed guards regularly patrolling them. If you plan to cross the border from Kuwait into Iraq, make sure you have the correct paperwork. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mofamission.gov.iq/en/Kuwait\">Iraqi Embassy to Kuwait\u2019s website</a> for more information</p>\n\n<p>Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. You should avoid off-road driving. If you do travel off-road, restrict your movements to clearly identifiable tracks, and take great care even if an area has been officially cleared. Don\u2019t pick up any metal, plastic or other objects lying around.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you have a visit visa, you can drive in Kuwait using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK licence. Since 28 March 2019, it has been a requirement to have the 1968 version of the IDP, with the 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK no longer accepted in Kuwait. You can only get IDPs over the counter from UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy one outside the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving you must obtain third party insurance in Kuwait. If you\u2019re hiring a car, you can usually get insurance through your car hire company. However, if you\u2019re planning to drive a car belonging to a relative or friend then you\u2019re responsible for obtaining insurance. The insurance document must be kept with you at all times while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you live, or are considering living in Kuwait, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kuwait\">Living in Kuwait guide</a> for information on driving licences.</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions are hazardous. Many drivers pay little attention to other road users; drive in excess of speed limits; switch lanes without warning; ignore traffic lights and use mobile phones while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a major accident, where there are serious injuries or your car is not drivable, you must stay with your vehicle if it is safe to do so, call the police on 112, and not attempt to move the vehicle before they arrive. If you have a minor accident, where there are no serious injuries, try to take pictures of any damage to the vehicles involved in the accident if it is safe to do so. Record the licence plate numbers of any vehicles involved, and, if it is drivable, move your car from the road to avoid blocking traffic (you can be fined if you fail to do so). Call the police and follow their instructions on what to do next.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah in the northern Gulf and both Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. The area in the northern Gulf, between Iran, Iraq and Kuwait has not been demarcated and vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. There have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Following maritime restrictions issued by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior in 2011, you should take extra care when sailing in Kuwaiti waters. You should also remain alert to the effect any regional tensions may have on your planned route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be under an increased risk of attack.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Recent developments in the Middle East have led to heightened tensions in the region. There have been a number of planned, peaceful protests in Kuwait City\u2019s Irada Square and smaller gatherings across the city, including at Kuwait University. You should continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds.\u00a0\u00a0Only Kuwaiti citizens have the legal right to assembly.</p>\n\n<p>Regional events continue to have an impact on local public opinion, with minor isolated cases of vandalism targets at and calls to boycott some international companies. You should be mindful of local sensitivities on these issues, follow the advice of the local authorities, and be alert to news reports and local and regional developments which might trigger public demonstrations.</p>\n",

You might be jetlagged and tired from your flight. Take regular rest breaks at the many rest stops on the roads.</p>\n\n<p>Australia is known for having larger distances between towns and amenities, make sure you have enough water before travelling and tell someone about your plans.</p>\n\n<p>Check road conditions before beginning your journey. Stay with your vehicle if it breaks down. Avoid travelling in extreme heat. Sudden storms and strong winds can make driving difficult. Take particular care when driving on unsealed roads, 4WD tracks and desert or beach roads. Northern Territory Police have in the past warned tourists to stay off unsealed tracks in remote areas of Central Australia following reports of stranded motorists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Australia using your UK driving licence as long as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you remain a temporary overseas visitor</li>\n  <li>your UK licence is valid</li>\n  <li>you have not been disqualified from driving anywhere</li>\n  <li>your licence is not suspended or cancelled, or your visiting driving privileges withdrawn</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you intend to stay in Australia and you hold a permanent visa, you can drive using your UK licence for a maximum of 3 months. To continue driving, you must get a local licence within this 3-month period.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry your driving licence and passport when driving.

Check your policy before you set off.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-laws\">Driving laws</h3>\n\n<p>Driving laws and regulations differ in each state and territory. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. The penalties can be severe.

Ensure you have a roadworthy vehicle fitted with GPS and 2 spare tyres. Take good maps and extra food, water and fuel. Plan your route carefully and get local advice before you set out. Leave your route details and expected time of return with the local tourist authorities, police, your hotel or hostel, or friends and relatives, and let them know when you\u2019ve arrived safely.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-on-kgari-fraser-island\">Driving on K\u2019gari (Fraser Island)</h3>\n\n<p>Following a number of serious accidents, all vehicles on K\u2019gari (Fraser Island) must keep to a maximum speed of 80km per hour on beaches and 30km per hour in towns. 4WD vehicles must have no more than 8 occupants (including the driver) and you must store all luggage inside the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid driving at night and be aware of beach hazards like ditches created by the surf. K\u2019gari is remote and emergency services can take many hours to reach an accident. Carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and personal medication as there is no pharmacy on the island.

Suriname also has a border dispute with French Guiana. Keep this in mind and take care in these border areas. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, all border crossing points in Suriname are closed until further notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban_en\">EU Air Safety List</a> was updated on 9 December 2019.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PZ\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Wing Airlines have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because the airline does not meet international safety standards. A full list of airlines banned from operating within the EU is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">European Commission website</a>. Refusal of permission to operate is often based on inspections of aircraft at EU airports. The fact that an airline is not included in the list doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been reports of attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Suriname.\u00a0Be vigilant and take suitable precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Driving in Suriname can be dangerous because of poor road sense of road-users, frequent hazards, inadequate lighting and poor road conditions in some areas. Drive defensively and limit driving at night as much as possible.  When driving at night take extra care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals.</p>\n\n<p>Only use taxis from reputable companies or those on official hotel taxi ranks. Don\u2019t hail taxis from the roadside.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Suriname with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n",

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Suriname as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. There is presently only one 24/7 medical facility available in Suriname, this is the Academisch Ziekenhuis in Paramaribo.</p>\n\n<p>Not all medical facilities accept payment from insurance companies.  Payment therefore may need to be made in advance and claimed back from the insurer.</p>\n\n<p>The UNAIDS country profile for Suriname estimated that in 2016 around 4,900 people were living with HIV. One of the key populations most affected by HIV in Suriname is sex workers, with an HIV prevalence of 5.8%. Since 2010, new HIV infections have decreased by 6% and AIDS-related deaths have increased by 17%.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 115 and ask for an ambulance.

These may change with little warning.

A Tropical Storm Watch is in place for the entirety of the coast.</p>\n\n<p>You should closely monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov\">US National Hurricane Center</a> and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator, including any evacuation orders. As of 29 October, the El Salvadoran government have declared a State of Emergency in response to storm Pilar.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">tropical cyclones page</a> for advice about how to prepare for travel during hurricane season and what to do ahead of a storm.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of a hurricane or tropical storm, there can be flooding, high winds and continued rainfall. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">tropical cyclones page</a> for further advice on what to expect in the aftermath of a storm.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to El Salvador are trouble free. El Salvador has until recently had one of the highest crime rates in Latin America. Despite recent progress made in security, the risks of both petty and violent crime remain. A State of Exception (Emergency) introduced in March 2022 in response to a sharp (and short lived) rise in the number of murders remains in place. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/el-salvador/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>On 15 January 2023, Direcci\u00f3n General de Protecci\u00f3n Civil issued a Red Alert in the municipalities of San Lorenzo and Ahuachapan, and a Green Alert in the rest of Ahuachapan and Santa Ana departments, after more than 200 small earth tremors where registered in less than 24 hours. For updated information, you should monitor local media and follow advice from authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/el-salvador/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>The rainy season runs from June to November and extreme weather events can lead to loss of life, damage to roads, property and infrastructure, and disruption to supplies, services and utilities. You should exercise extra caution if travelling and follow the advice and instructions of local authorities. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/el-salvador/natural-disasters#rainy-season\">Rainy season</a></p>\n\n<p>Political tensions in El Salvador remain high; public rallies and demonstrations occasionally see violence or public disorder. The El Salvador Constitution prohibits political activities by foreign nationals, and participation in demonstrations may result in detention and/or deportation.

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>El Salvador has until recently had one of the highest crime rates in Latin America, and whilst progress has been made, risks from both petty crime and violent crime remain.</p>\n\n<p>A State of Exception (Emergency) was introduced by the Government in March 2022 in response to a sharp rise in the number of murders.  It has been repeatedly extended on a monthly basis and remains in force. Whilst the murder rate has fallen significantly, concerns remain that gangs could regroup. The state of exception (emergency) gives police additional powers. This has resulted in a much higher number of arrests, sometimes on flimsy evidence. It also allows people to be detained for much longer before trial. Many ordinary legal safeguards have also been weakened or removed (e.g. joint hearings of over 100 people are common). There are reports that some embassies have struggled to get consular access. If you are arrested, the British Embassy may not be given access to you to provide consular assistance, or to ensure you are able to receive legal representation.  There are reports of mistreatment and human rights violations, sometimes resulting in death, in detention facilities.</p>\n\n<p>While security operations have taken place across the country, both security operations and gang-related violence occur away from tourists and visitors. Security operations have taken place across the country, with a particular focus in Soyapango, Ilopango, Mejicanos, San Martin, and San Marcos.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 August, President Bukele ordered the military siege of the Caba\u00f1as Department, deploying over 8,000 security forces to detain remaining alleged gang members in this area. Take particular care if travelling into this zone as there is risk of being caught up in any military action.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to El Salvador are trouble-free but there have been isolated attacks on tourists including robberies, car-jackings and violent assaults.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care in more  run down areas of towns and cities  and areas less frequented by tourists. Take local advice on where the safer areas are, but always take care. Avoid wearing expensive jewellery or displaying valuable items. Safeguard your passport, mobile phone and cash against pickpockets.</p>\n\n<p>Within San Salvador the areas of Santa Elena, San Benito and Maquilishuat have better security, as do most of the larger shopping malls.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take care when travelling alone; it may be safer to travel with others or take part in a tour with a reputable company; the same applies to walking on remote trails; there have been reports of opportunistic attacks on tourists walking alone</li>\n  <li>if possible keep your valuables including your passport in a safe; carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes; take particular care of your personal belongings at bus stations, airports, tourist sites and on public transport</li>\n  <li>avoid displaying items of value, particularly when arriving at the airport; foreigners have been targeted when leaving the airport; don\u2019t wear expensive jewellery and only carry minimal amounts of cash</li>\n  <li>it\u2019s safer to withdraw money from ATMs in shopping centres or change money in hotels or banks; don\u2019t withdraw too much money at one time; foreigners have been attacked after withdrawing money from ATMs; don\u2019t use ATMs at night or in isolated or badly lit areas</li>\n  <li>stick to main roads; avoid travelling on unsurfaced roads as you are at greater risk of attack in remote areas where there are fewer police patrols</li>\n  <li>public buses (repainted old US school buses) are not safe; private inter-city buses are generally safer, although attacks can also occur on these; only use reputable coach companies; for shorter trips within towns and cities, take radio, pre-booked or hotel taxis operated by reputable companies; don\u2019t use unofficial taxis there remains a small risk of kidnapping. The risk of kidnapping to foreigners or visitors is relatively low, despite an increase in kidnapping of Salvadorans. You might wish to share your location or plans with a trusted person, particularly if taking public transport or a taxi despite success by the national police in tackling the problem in recent years; kidnap gangs generally target rich Salvadorians rather than visitors</li>\n  <li>if you\u2019re driving, take extra care at junctions, where stationary traffic is often targeted by armed robbers.in the event of a robbery, do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can cause great financial loss. If you, or your relatives/friends are asked to transfer money to El Salvador, make sure it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-spaces-and-services\">Public spaces and services</h3>\n\n<p>On 20 May 2023, at least 12 people died and more than 500 were injured during a football match at the Cuscatl\u00e1n Stadium. This was due to overcrowding. If attending events in crowded places and at large gatherings, follow the advice of the local authorities and maintain a high level of security awareness.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Should you have any questions on security or local travel; you can call the local tourist police - POLITUR on +503 2224-2705, email them at <a href=\"mailto:info@politurelsalvador.com\">info@politurelsalvador.com</a> or visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/politurelsalvador.com/web/otras-actividades/Home\">POLITUR website</a> for more info.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can use your UK Driving Licence to drive in El Salvador for visits of under three months. However, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit</a> is recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are variable and you should expect the unexpected. Lane discipline is poor. Car insurance is essential. If you are involved in an accident, contact the national police or the fire brigade by dialling 911. If you are involved in an accident, you should normally wait for the police to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Always lock doors and keep windows closed.</p>\n\n<p>Roads between the main tourist locations in El Salvador are of a good or acceptable standard. Sometimes manhole covers are stolen, leaving large holes in the road. In more isolated locations, roads are unsurfaced and four-wheel drive vehicles are advisable.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care when travelling to/from the border with Guatemala. There have been reports of violent attacks on vehicles, particularly on the Guatemalan side of the border. Vehicles with El Salvador number plates are often targeted. It\u2019s better to cross borders in the morning, giving you time to reach your destination before dark. Borders sometimes close in the early evening. Private bus companies are considered safer than public buses for crossing borders.</p>\n\n<p>There may be a small risk of unexploded ordnance (e.g. landmines) in remote areas.\u00a0If you are going off-road take local advice and avoid travel to such areas if advised.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>Swimming on the Pacific coast can be dangerous due to strong undertows. The currents around La Bocana de San Diego are particularly treacherous. Several people have drowned in recent years. There are very few or no lifeguards. You should avoid swimming on isolated beaches, especially after consuming alcohol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Political tensions in El Salvador remain high and can be expected to increase in the run up to Presidential, Assembly, Municipal, and Central American Parliament elections in February/March 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The El Salvador Constitution prohibits political activities by foreign nationals, and participation in demonstrations may result in detention and/or deportation. You should avoid large gatherings or demonstrations and exercise caution in public areas.</p>\n\n<p>On 15 September 2021, San Salvador saw significant public protests over political issues; although the protests were peaceful and there were no injuries there was significant damage to property. On 31 January 2021 in San Salvador gunmen opened fire on activists from one of El Salvador\u2019s main opposition parties, killing two people, and injuring five other people.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in El Salvador reopened in May 2012, but the Embassy doesn\u2019t have a dedicated consular section. For consular assistance during and outside office hours, weekends or holidays, dial (503) 2511 5757 and follow instructions to be transferred to a consular officer. For non urgent assistance email enquiries you can contact: <a href=\"mailto:Guatemala.Consulate@fcdo.gov.uk\">Guatemala.Consulate@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n",

British Nationals considering using Bitcoin should ensure that they understand the processes and risks involved, and that they have access to US dollars if they need them.</p>\n\n<p>It is almost impossible to change pounds sterling anywhere in El Salvador, so you should bring a mixture of cash and travellers\u2019 cheques in US dollars. US$50 and US$100 notes are generally not accepted in many smaller restaurants, bars and shops. US$100 and US$50 notes may be exchanged in banks on arrival, but it is advisable to bring smaller denominations with you.</p>\n\n<p>Regular ATMs and Bitcoin ATMs are widely available particularly in San Salvador and La Libertad. You should inform your bank of your travel plans before you travel to avoid your card being blocked.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Access to other websites can be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>More information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rkn.gov.ru/\">Federal Service for Surveillance of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media</a> (in Russian).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"racial-discrimination\">Racial discrimination</h3>\n\n<p>Most visitors experience no problems but racial discrimination can happen in some areas. If you\u2019re of African, Asian or Caribbean descent, you may receive unwanted attention in public places. Take care, particularly when travelling late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia. However, attitudes towards the LGBT+ community and LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK and vary in different locations. Government officials have made derogatory comments to LGBT+ individuals. New legislation bans people from promoting \u2018non-traditional sexual relations\u2019 to minors. Foreign citizens could face fines, up to 15 days in jail, or deportation. Public displays of affection may receive negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, Russia was ranked 46 out of 49 European countries for LGBT+ rights by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rainbow-europe.org/#8656/0/0\">ILGA-Europe</a>. There are no laws to protect LGBT+ people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Recent laws targeting LGBT+ communities include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2012, Moscow Pride was banned for 100 years</li>\n  <li>in 2022 , new laws banned the \u2018demonstration of LGBT information, promotion of non-traditional sexual relations and change of gender\u2019 to children and adults through the internet, films, advertisement, audio visual services and books (the \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Harassment, threats, and acts of violence towards the LGBT+ community have increased. Penalties for foreign nationals may include arrest and detention, fines and deportation.</p>\n\n<p>The North Caucasus republics are particularly intolerant of the LGBT+ community. There have been reports of the arrest, torture and killing of gay men in Chechnya, allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Read <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-activities\">Religious activities</h3>\n\n<p>Some religious activities are restricted, including preaching and distributing religious materials.</p>\n\n<p>Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are considered an extremist organisation in Russia. They can face harassment from authorities, including detention, particularly at places of worship.</p>\n\n<p>Some other minority religious groups, like Scientologists, also face discrimination.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Russia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/russia/\">RAC Russia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a valid UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Russia. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety in Russia is poor and road conditions unpredictable. Take care when driving, take account of weather conditions and consider avoiding driving at night. Do not drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road. Do not pick up hitchhikers.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic police will often stop drivers for spot checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-vehicles-into-russia\">Bringing vehicles into Russia</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive into Russia, you must declare your vehicle to the customs authority on entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for up to one year.</p>\n\n<p>Green cards are no longer accepted as proof of car or road insurance. Check insurance requirements before entering.</p>\n\n<p>For questions about bringing a vehicle into Russia, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://london.mid.ru/en/\">Russian Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avoiding-unregistered-taxis\">Avoiding unregistered taxis</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals travelling in unregistered taxis have been victims of crime. Taxis that look official can be unlicensed. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use a local taxi app to call a registered taxi</li>\n  <li>ask your hotel to call a taxi or give you the number of a reputable company</li>\n  <li>agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not flag down a taxi or share a taxi with strangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Railway stations have airport-style security. Many railway services require passengers to show their passports on boarding.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling by overnight train, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Do not look after luggage for other travelers or let it be stored in your compartment.</p>\n\n<p>Do not leave your sleeping compartment empty, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains, there may be an extra security device attached to the fitted handle or lock. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being opened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Air space will close during drone attacks. This has led to frequent and unpredictable delays, diversions and cancellations to flights in and out of airports in European Russia.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on domestic flights to a number of airports in southern Russia, with disruption to internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-safety\">Air safety</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>) lists all known airlines in Russia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.  Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government has sanctioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Aeroflot</li>\n  <li>Rossiya Airlines</li>\n  <li>Ural Airlines</li>\n  <li>Russian Railways</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British nationals can buy flight tickets as long as the journey is starting in, or within, Russia without breaching UK sanctions.

If staff need to travel internally, they may use airlines which also fly to internationally to countries where international safety standards are maintained or on Western manufactured aircraft.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travellers-with-limited-mobility\">Travellers with limited mobility</h3>\n\n<p>Wheelchair access can be limited in some public areas.

Your hire car company may be able to help with this.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Some roads, particularly in more remote areas, may be in poor condition. Driving is erratic and there are frequent road accidents, particularly at night. Pedestrians and animals often appear in the road without warning. Riding a motorbike can be particularly dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a collision, stay at the site of the accident with your vehicle as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe or if you feel threatened, report to the local police station.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are still security checkpoints on main roads in parts of the country. Follow the instructions of the police or army officers on duty. Security forces have opened fire on vehicles that have not stopped when asked.

Change to a different tuk-tuk or taxi if you have any concerns about the driver or their standard of driving.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You may have difficulty getting a taxi or tuk-tuk if there are fuel shortages. There may be limited or no service during curfews.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>When travelling by train, make sure you stay within the train carriage while the train is moving.

Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.</p>\n\n<p>You can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>as a tourist</li>\n  <li>to visit family or friends</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>to attend business meetings cultural or sports events</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>for short-term studies or training</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to Bulgaria without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Bulgarian government\u2019s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bulgarianembassy-london.org/\">Bulgarian Embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay in Bulgaria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/36/bulgaria\">check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.bg/wps/portal/agency-en/home/info-citizens/Important%20notice%20for%20travelers\">goods you can take into or out of Bulgaria</a>.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>On 30 December 2016, the Bulgarian Minister of Interior,  announced heightened security measures in all cities, winter ski resorts, and places where large gatherings are expected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities and late at night. Watch out for pickpockets and bag thefts in tourist areas, on buses and trains and major public transport hubs, including airports.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists are targeted by thieves and pickpockets in Sunny Beach and other larger cities and resorts. Do not take valuables to the beach and be wary of poorly lit roads around the resort at night. Thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach have increased.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Some tourists have been the victims of overcharging in so-called \u2018gentlemen\u2019s clubs\u2019 in Sofia and in some resorts including Bansko, Borovets and Sunny Beach. Overcharging can amount to hundreds of pounds. Victims can be threatened with violence if they refuse to pay. Seek recommendations for bars and clubs from trustworthy sources like your hotel or other holidaymakers. When paying by credit or debit card make sure the transaction is completed in your presence and be wary of attempts to make you re-enter your pin number.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property-in-bulgaria\">Buying property in Bulgaria</h3>\n\n<p>Buyers have been defrauded while buying property. Be cautious and get comprehensive legal advice before you buy. Only deal with established and reputable real estate agents or with other contacts who you know to be reliable and genuine.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in or moving to Bulgaria, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria\">living in Bulgaria</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotels-and-accommodation\">Hotels and accommodation</h3>\n\n<p>There have been burglaries from hotel rooms in Sunny Beach. Make sure you lock your room (including windows and balcony doors) and keep valuables locked in a safe.</p>\n\n<p>There have been break-ins at properties in the residential areas of cities, and rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Distraction theft can occur, with car tyres being deliberately punctured. When drivers investigate the puncture, thieves can distract them and steal personal belongings and documents from the vehicle. If you must stop, make sure your belongings are secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stray-dogs\">Stray dogs</h3>\n\n<p>Stray dogs are common and can be dangerous.\u202fAvoid getting too close to stray dogs, especially if they are in a pack. Take any animal bites seriously and seek immediate medical advice as rabies and other animal-borne diseases are present in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Sporadic protests occur across Bulgaria, which can cause occasional disruption with roadblocks and transport links. Avoid all protests and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to carry a form of ID or copy of the information pages of your passport at all times as proof of identity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-items-illegal-in-the-uk\">Buying items illegal in the UK</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s possible to buy weapons in Bulgaria that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/import-controls-on-offensive-weapons\">are illegal in the UK</a>. Importing them could result in a prison sentence. For example, some shops in and around Burgas and Sunny Beach sell weapons like stun guns, torch stun guns, knives, pepper spray and CS gas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-sex-offences\">Illegal drugs and sex offences</h3>\n\n<p>The Bulgarian authorities treat all drug-related and sex offences very seriously. Prison sentences can be expected for any foreigners convicted of such offences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drunken-and-disorderly-behaviour\">Drunken and disorderly behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Offences relating to drunken, disorderly behaviour and hooliganism may be treated more seriously than in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking photographs near potentially sensitive areas like military establishments. If in doubt, ask permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are not illegal, but public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and the LGBT+ community generally keeps a low profile.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few gay bars and clubs in Sofia. The city also holds the annual Sofia Pride. Sofia Pride is growing in popularity and was attended in recent years by over 10,000 people. However, it attracts some negative attention locally and is held with a heightened police presence and security measures. If you want to join the parade, read the organisers\u2019 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.sofiapride.org/terms-for-participation-and-safety-rules/\">Sofia Pride safety rules</a>. These also contain telephone numbers of local civil society organisations able to provide further advice on reporting of incidents of hate crime. In 2023, a small number of incidents of hate crime were directed at those attending events related to Sofia Pride, including visitors to Bulgaria. These mainly consisted of verbal abuse and vandalism.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes outside Sofia tend to be more conservative. There have been isolated cases of hostility towards people perceived to be from LGBT+ communities reported in Burgas and Plovdiv. You can find local information on LGBT+ issues in Bulgaria on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bghelsinki.org/en/themes/lgbti\">Bulgarian Helsinki Committee</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information for LGBT+ travellers</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ban-on-face-covering\">Ban on face covering</h3>\n\n<p>Covering your face with garments (such as a burka or similar head covering) in public places, including government buildings, streets, parks, gardens, restaurants, shops and on public transport is illegal in Bulgaria. There is a fine for covering your face in public places.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>The condition of pavements, including in the centres of big cities, can be very poor and care should be taken. Travellers with mobility difficulties may find it challenging to move around independently, including on public transport deemed to be accessible. Lifts to platforms and stations on the Sofia Metro system, are sometimes out of order. The Blue Badge Scheme operates in Bulgaria and there are often spaces reserved for badge holders in shopping centres and on-street parking locations in city-centres. Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disabled-travellers/disability-and-travel-abroad\">information for disabled travellers</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive in Bulgaria, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bulgaria/\">RAC Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>If you enter Bulgaria in a private vehicle, you must have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>your driving licence</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>all original registration and ownership documents</li>\n  <li>evidence of insurance valid in Bulgaria</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, you must have the original contract document, stating that the vehicle can be brought into Bulgaria. Border officials will impound your vehicle if they are not satisfied that you own it or have permission to use it in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles that are registered outside the EU are considered to be \u2018temporarily imported\u2019 when driven inside Bulgaria. If they are stolen whilst in Bulgaria, the owners will be liable for import duty and related taxes. This includes cars which are registered in the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Bulgaria, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria\">living in Bulgaria</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. These have replaced GB stickers. Check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">GOV.UK guidance on displaying number plates </a> for more information on driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Road conditions can be dangerous. Take care when driving, particularly at night and outside major cities. Many roads (and pavements) are in poor condition and road works are often unlit or unmarked. Driving standards are generally poor, and drivers can be aggressive, particularly on motorways. Avoid confrontations. Stick to the speed limit and make sure your vehicle is roadworthy. There are on-the-spot fines for minor violations. It is not unusual to encounter slow-moving cars and animal-drawn vehicles on the roads, particularly in rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to use motorways and main roads outside towns, you\u2019ll need to buy a vignette (ticket) in advance of your journey. The vignette is a form of toll. If you use the roads without purchasing a vignette, you will be fined. For more information on cost and where to buy a vignette, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tolltickets.com/en/country/bulgarien/\">BG Toll website</a>. You must drive with running lights or dipped beam headlights throughout the year, even during the daytime. For rules on what equipment you must carry in the vehicle, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bulgaria/\">RAC Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis may not be in very good condition. Most taxis are on a meter and yellow taxis are generally considered reliable. Avoid taxis parked outside hotels or in tourist areas. Ask your hotel to call a taxi or flag down a passing taxi with a green \u2018available\u2019 light in the window. Check the licence sticker and the tariffs on the window before getting in as cost can vary considerably.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behavior by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach. Use a taxi recommended by your tour operator or accommodation provider.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in unlicensed taxis from Sofia airport overcharging passengers. If you\u2019re travelling from the airport, make sure you take an official, licensed taxi. There is an official taxi rank in the arrivals hall. Check that the taxi meter is working before starting your journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-and-bus-travel\">Rail and bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves operate on trains. Make sure that documents and valuables are safe. The train system is very poor by European standards. There have been several fires on Bulgarian trains. Bulgaria has a comprehensive rail network but trains can be cancelled at short notice and rail travel is slow by European standards. For travel updates see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bdz.bg/en\">Bulgaria Railways website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Intercity bus travel is generally reliable and cheap by UK standards, but the roadworthiness of vehicles and driving standards are not always as they should be, and there have been a number of serious accidents in recent years.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>In summer and early autumn, Bulgaria is on a regular alert for wildfires. There is danger of large-scale and quick-spreading fires in forests and fields. Follow media reports and the advice of local authorities if wildfires occur in your area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Many parts of Bulgaria can flood following heavy rains. Flooding is usually localised but can occasionally be widespread and has caused deaths.

However you should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media\u00a0</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator\u00a0</li>\n  <li>reconsider travel to affected areas\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. Comply with the law, including in relation to carrying ID cards, and possession of foreign currency and weapons. Avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strikes-and-protests\">Strikes and protests</h3>\n\n<p>Because of  frequent civil unrest, including protests and strikes, there is frequently:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks</li>\n  <li>disruption to local businesses and transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There is a risk of kidnapping in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region and on the southern border with Kenya. This is particularly the case in the eastern areas where <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping in western areas of Oromia region, particularly West Wollega, East Wollega and Qellem Wollega zones. Recent kidnaps have targeted the mining industry. British nationals working in the area should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement and aim to only travel during daylight hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Stay vigilant at all times. Make sure you carefully consider the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place. People engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"detention-of-british-nationals\">Detention of British nationals\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia. The risk may increase if tensions are heightened around major events, or in locations that are sensitive for security reasons. Carry photocopies of your passport and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-addis-ababa\">contact details of the British Embassy Addis Ababa</a> in case you are questioned or detained. Your physical passport is not necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopian authorities do not always notify embassies when foreign nationals are detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always provided. If authorities do not inform the embassy, ask family or friends to contact the British Embassy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can be targeted by groups of youths through pickpocketing and scams.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Theft and mugging is on the rise. There has been a smaller number of more serious incidents, including sexual harassment of women. Violent robberies can occur in parks and walking sites in Addis Ababa.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Take care of your belongings when visiting crowded public places, especially at night. Be vigilant if strangers approach you. Criminal gangs use distraction techniques including begging, spitting, spilling food and drink, and feigning illness.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of pickpocketing, bag and jewellery snatching, including from vehicles at traffic lights.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When travelling in vehicles, you should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep belongings with you\u00a0</li>\n  <li>keep valuables out of sight\u00a0</li>\n  <li>keep vehicle doors locked\u00a0</li>\n  <li>park in well-lit and guarded areas such as hotels, government and tourist locations, which all have security at their entrances\u00a0</li>\n  <li>consider fitting anti-shatter film to all windows (we do not recommend short term visitors modify their hire vehicles)\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If threatened, hand over valuables without resistance.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-and-safety\">Health and safety\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"date-and-time\">Date and time\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Traditionally Ethiopia has a different calendar and way of expressing time than are widely used internationally.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Most hotels and larger organisations\u2019 documents, including airline tickets, use the international calendar and clock. However:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>official documents are often dated using the Ethiopian calendar\u00a0</li>\n  <li>individuals and smaller organisations might use the Ethiopian clock\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Ethiopia is a cash-based society. Banking facilities, including card payments and ATMs are limited, especially outside of cities. It is not normally possible to get a cash advance. Make sure you have enough cash before leaving cities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Drug offences are treated seriously in Ethiopia. Possession of drugs can lead to prison sentences of 5 to 10 years and potentially large fines.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Khat is legal in Ethiopia but it is illegal to take it out of the country. Bags are regularly searched at Addis Ababa Bole Airport. Anyone found with khat is likely to be prosecuted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>There are no restrictions on buying or possessing alcohol. This includes the predominantly Muslim regions although it may be more difficult to obtain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Ethiopia is religiously diverse and largely tolerant. However, many people are devout in their faith. Take care to not offend local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively and observe local customs. Take particular care if travelling:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan\u00a0</li>\n  <li>to religious sites of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church\u00a0</li>\n  <li>outside Addis Ababa, particularly in rural areas\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ramadan is individually observed but there are no official regulations imposed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"women-travellers\">Women travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Women are expected to dress conservatively, especially when visiting religious sites.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal and carry penalties of between 1 and 15 years imprisonment. It is reported that the local authorities are intimidating owners and clients of hotels, bars and restaurants in Addis Ababa where same-sex activity is alleged to take place.</p>\n\n<p>The public are not generally accepting of same-sex relationships. Some religious leaders have called for violence against the LGBT+ community. Be aware of local laws and customs. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"imports-and-exports\">Imports and exports\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need an export certificate to take antiques out of the country. Without one your items are likely to be confiscated and you could be prosecuted.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Owning ivory is illegal. British nationals have had ivory jewellery confiscated and been fined up to 25,000 Ethiopian birr.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photos:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>near military zones or of military personnel\u00a0</li>\n  <li>near the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa\u00a0</li>\n  <li>where signs prohibit photography\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"satellite-phones-and-binoculars\">Satellite phones and binoculars\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Satellite phones and binoculars cannot be imported or exported to or from Ethiopia without prior approval from the Customs and Information Network and Security Agency. Get advice from your travel provider on permissions required.</p>\n\n<p>Unapproved items can be confiscated by authorities, with the possibility of being able to collect them on departure from Ethiopia, but this is not guaranteed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The importation and use of drones within Ethiopia is subject to permission by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority and Information Network and Security Agency. Without written clearance drones can be subject to confiscation at airports or borders.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rural-areas\">Rural areas\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>When travelling outside Addis Ababa, avoid driving after dark. Vehicles often have no lights and livestock may roam on roads.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While mobile telephone services are increasingly widespread, connectivity cannot be guaranteed. Mobile internet can be closed down with no notice.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You might want to consider travelling in a group and leaving details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cars-and-motorbikes-\">Cars and motorbikes \u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and traffic accidents happen regularly, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. If you\u2019re involved in a traffic accident, stay in your vehicle and call the local police. Avoid confrontation and wait for police to arrive to deal with any issues.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Localised demonstrations have led to temporary road closures or the targeting of public transport. However, not all social media reports of such disruptions are accurate. If unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you\u2019re travelling to.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you meet a roadblock, follow advice of local authorities if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and do not attempt to pass it.\u00a0</p>\n\n",

If your company has such instructions you should read them in conjunction with this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high level of crime in Luanda, some of it violent. Muggings, particularly to steal mobile phones and other valuables, and armed robberies can occur in any area at any time of the day or night. Areas popular with foreigners are particular targets. You should be particularly careful when withdrawing money from banks and ATMs both during daytime and at night, as people doing so have been the subject of armed robberies, some of which have been fatal.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of rape have been reported in popular nightlife areas, as well as in private homes. Don\u2019t travel alone at night.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid walking around Luanda, especially after dark. Avoid wearing jewellery or watches in public places. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Avoid walking between bars and restaurants on the Ilha do Cabo, and avoid crowded places like markets and all large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Theft from stationary or slow-moving cars is common in downtown Luanda. Keep valuables out of sight and don\u2019t use mobiles or laptops while in traffic. A high proportion of the civilian population is armed.\nWhen driving, be very wary if another car signals you to pull over. Thieves use the pretext of a minor traffic incident to get you out of your car either to steal it or to rob you.</p>\n\n<p>Deposit valuables and cash in a hotel safe where practical. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport, in a separate place from the documents themselves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to Cabinda province (but not including Cabinda city). There are regular violent incidents including rape, murder and kidnappings involving foreigners and Angolans in the province of Cabinda. Groups claiming responsibility for these attacks have declared their intention to continue attacks against foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to within 1km of the border between Angola\u2019s Lunda Norte province and the Democratic Republic of Congo, except at official border crossings and their access roads. Please note that the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo provinces of Kasa\u00ef and Kasa\u00ef Central, which border Lunda Norte province.</p>\n\n<p>The Angolan authorities are sensitive to the presence of foreigners in diamond-producing areas, including the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul. Restrictions may be imposed on your movement and you may be detained by the security forces if you do not comply.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the instructions of local authorities. The presence of diamonds also increases the threat of crime and banditry, particularly on roads leading to and from these areas. Armed hold-ups occur from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel outside Luanda and the provincial capitals, do so in the company of persons or organisations experienced in local conditions, as conditions can be difficult. You may be asked to show your passport and Angolan visa to the local authorities. There is widespread poverty, social exclusion and disease, a shattered infrastructure and mines and items of unexploded ordnance throughout many parts of the country. Transport and accommodation are extremely limited outside Luanda, so make arrangements in advance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Although you can drive on a UK licence for up to 30 days from the date of your arrival in Angola, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or translation of your UK licence is recommended. Make sure all vehicle documentation is available for inspection. Police check points are common.</p>\n\n<p>Major roads between Luanda and the provincial capitals are improving, but driving standards and some road conditions are poor and travel outside major towns is usually in convoys of two or more 4-wheel drive vehicles. Outside major towns, mines and unexploded ordnance remain a problem, including on roads, verges and bridges, in buildings and in the countryside. There have been incidents of mines exploding with loss of life in places previously thought to be safe. Even in \u2018cleared\u2019 areas, you should keep to well-established routes and take up-to-date advice from the United Nations or an international Non-Governmental Organisation.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (November-April), bridges and roads risk being washed away by sudden floods and there is an increased chance of mines becoming displaced and surfacing outside known mine fields.</p>\n\n<p>There are taxis at the airport and these can also be booked through your hotel or with the company direct. Local minibus transport is unsafe. In most cases your sponsor will arrange to meet you at the airport and to provide transport throughout your trip.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Angola that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>TAAG, the Angolan national carrier and Heli Malongo Aviacao e Servicos De Angola, LDA dba Heli-Malongo  are the only carrier regulated by the Angolan civil aviation authority permitted to operate flights to/from the UK. UK government employees are permitted to travel with TAAG; they are not permitted to use other Angolan airlines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (November to April), Angola experiences storms and heavy downpours. This can cause sudden and serious flooding in and around cities, including the capital Luanda. This can create hazardous conditions and can cause serious damage to buildings and bridges. Flooding can also increase the risk of road subsidence. You should remain indoors during heavy and prolonged downpours</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"shortages\">Shortages</h3>\n\n<p>There are occasional shortages of petrol and diesel. Power and water can be cut off for days without notice. Residents should keep generator fuel stocks and water tanks topped up. Drinking water and other food supplies are not always readily available. You should keep stocks of tinned goods and drinking water.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotels\">Hotels</h3>\n\n<p>Hotels are expensive and of varied quality.  Although availability of hotel accommodation has improved, hotels should be booked well in advance. The British Embassy is unable to book hotel rooms on your behalf.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"communications\">Communications</h3>\n\n<p>Not all UK mobile phone companies have roaming arrangements with Angola. SMS text messages may not get through. Mobile coverage outside the main urban areas is patchy. When travelling outside Luanda carry a mobile phone with contracts to multiple local carriers as coverage for each provider varies throughout the country.</p>\n\n",

A money belt under your clothes is the safest option.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"theft\">Theft</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves and pickpockets operate on public transport, bus and train terminals.</p>\n\n<p>Thieves posing as hotel guests snatch bags while tourists are checking into hotels or hostels. Handbags can be cut open in crowded places and mobile phones have been snatched while being used on the street. Thieves on motorbikes can snatch bags from pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Thefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars, are common.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep your valuables out of sight or close to you</li>\n  <li>avoid hanging bags on the back of your chair</li>\n  <li>avoid using ATMs at night</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings when withdrawing money</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-crime-and-scams\">Street crime and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to street crime, especially thieves (often women) using distraction techniques. A common form of distraction theft reported in Buenos Aires is the \u2018mustard scam\u2019. Thieves will rob tourists while an accomplice pretends to help remove mustard that has been accidentally sprayed on them. If this happens to you, politely but firmly refuse assistance and walk away.</p>\n\n<p>In Buenos Aires, be particularly cautious in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Palermo</li>\n  <li>San Telmo</li>\n  <li>La Boca</li>\n  <li>Retiro</li>\n  <li>Florida Street</li>\n  <li>9 de Julio</li>\n  <li>Avenida de Mayo</li>\n  <li>Rivadavia Avenues near the obelisk</li>\n  <li>the Retiro Bus terminal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Mendoza, be particularly cautious downtown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent and armed robberies can happen in the streets immediately outside the Caminito tourist area in La Boca. Stay in the designated tourist area where there are high-visibility police patrols. If robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Kidnappings and \u2018express kidnappings\u2019 occasionally occur in Argentina. Victims are held and forced to empty their bank accounts in different ATMs after which they are normally quickly released.</p>\n\n<p>For English-language assistance, safety tips issued by the City of Buenos Aires, or to file a police report online, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://turistas.seguridadciudad.gob.ar/\">the Buenos Aires Police website</a> (only accessible in Argentina).

Do not leave food or drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and do not accept them from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risk of bringing people you don\u2019t know well into your accommodation. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but there have been reports of foreign tourists being robbed or assaulted after inviting new acquaintances, met online or in person, into their accommodation. Be alert to the possible use of \u2018date rape\u2019 and other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t become involved with illegal drugs of any kind.

If you\u2019re travelling to Argentina and think you may be affected by this type of legal action, seek independent legal advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>If you take part in extreme or adventure sports (including paragliding, climbing, off-road driving and hot air ballooning), make sure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>adequate safety precautions are in place</li>\n  <li>you only use reputable operators and insist on training</li>\n  <li>your travel insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will have to pay for most helicopter rescues, including in Mount Aconcagua.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Argentina. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You will need an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> to drive in Argentina.</p>\n\n<p>Respect for speed limits and traffic signals varies  and drivers can make unexpected manoeuvres. Crime against car users, particularly when stationary at traffic lights, is a problem.\u00a0 Always keep car windows closed and doors locked in major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving in the province of Misiones, close to the borders with Paraguay and Brazil; the area is used to smuggle goods. Seek local advice from customs officials if you intend to drive in this area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Book taxis in advance if possible. If you hail a taxi in the street, only use a \u2018radio taxi\u2019. These have a clearly visible logo on the car doors.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/transportes-autorizados-pasajeros\">City of Buenos Aires\u2019 government site for a downloadable list of registered taxi companies</a> with their contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Flights from Argentina can be unreliable and susceptible to delays and cancellations. Check the status of your flight with your airline or travel company before travelling to the airport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been cases of disruption by activist groups and unions against British-flagged shipping, and shipping involved in hydrocarbons or fishing activity in the Falkland Islands. If you\u2019re responsible for a vessel, contact your agent or the local authorities before travelling. Most cruise ships and visiting tourists should not be affected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Many northern provinces experience occasional flooding. This can disrupt transport and delivery of food. Flash floods can occur during heavy rains, in provinces including Buenos Aires. Monitor local media and follow instructions given by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>The Copahue Volcano on the Argentina-Chile border erupts occasionally, and residents are evacuated.
