The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires. If you overstay, you may get a fine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you\u2019re expelled from one of these countries, you\u2019re also excluded from the other 3.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If\u00a0you\u2019re planning to travel to Nicaragua, check entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan immigration authorities or the nearest Nicaraguan Embassy. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nicaragua/\">travel advice for Nicaragua</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"airport-tax\">Airport tax</h2>\n\n<p>You must pay airport departure tax of 30 US dollars (or the same amount in Guatemalan quetzal). This is normally included in the price of your ticket.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"illegal-entry-fees-at-land-borders\">Illegal entry fees at land borders</h2>\n\n<p>Guatemalan customs or immigration officials sometimes ask travellers crossing land borders to pay an \u2018entry fee\u2019. This is illegal. If you are asked to pay a fee, ask for an official receipt, and you may find the officials drop the request.</p>\n\n<p>When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country. They may be trying to overcharge you for unnecessary services.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/96/guatemala\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Guatemala guide</a>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever certificate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guatemala.

This resulted in a number of protests and roadblocks across the country. Whilst a majority of the roadblocks have been lifted, some remain and the risk of others being created is likely.</p>\n\n<p>See a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTP3L7L40wPzWQyqeQFfxGogSqdBYdUV3Wy9sfLs3sFlkiSb5KKCyGJ2ptGQXtQH5dTqEHon-9MwBhS/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true\">list of protests and roadblocks (\u2018bloqueados\u2019)</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>Events are fast moving, and the situation has potential to deteriorate without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the protests have been peaceful, but there have clashes between protestors and police, with the use of tear gas.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all protests and roadblocks and check with local authorities as well as media outlets for the latest information. It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities in Guatemala. If you take part in protests, you may be detained and asked to leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of political violence, strikes and large demonstrations can occur, often with little or no notice. Most demonstrations are peaceful, but they can turn violent. Protestors may block roads and public facilities, including the international airport, without notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Guatemala has one of the highest violent crime rates in Latin America. Although most of the serious crime involves local gangs, incidents are usually indiscriminate and can take place in tourist areas.</p>\n\n<p>No parts of Guatemala City are free from crime, including Zone 10 (Zona Viva), which is popular with tourists and foreign residents. Take care in Zone 1 (the historical centre), where cheaper hotels are located and several bus routes end.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed attacks on tourists travelling by road to and from major tourist sites like Antigua, Tikal, Pet\u00e9n and Lake Atitl\u00e1n. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Carjacking and armed robbery are common on the main road (Carretera Salvador) leading from Guatemala City to the border with El Salvador. Express kidnappings are common in Guatemala. Victims of this type of kidnapping are usually taken to ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible before they\u2019re released. The use of guns or knives is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Violent attacks, including sexual assault, can take place anywhere and at any time of the day. They usually involve firearms and motorbike riders. Attackers have killed and injured victims who resisted. There is a low arrest and conviction rate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>You can take precautions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not displaying valuables like laptops, cameras and mobile phones</li>\n  <li>not wearing a lot of jewellery</li>\n  <li>carrying only small amounts of cash \u2013 avoid withdrawing a lot of money, particularly at night</li>\n  <li>keeping valuables safe (for example, in a hotel safe)</li>\n  <li>not travelling alone or at night, especially near borders or in areas without many people</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you go to remote areas, it may be safer to travel with others or a reputable tour company.</p>\n\n<p>For shorter trips within towns and cities the safest option is to take radio-dispatched taxis (which are usually yellow) or hotel taxis. You can buy pre-paid taxi vouchers from the office of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://inguat.gob.gt/\"><abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr>, Guatemala\u2019s tourist agency</a> (in Spanish) in the airport\u2019s arrivals terminal.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re driving, it is generally safer to travel on main roads. There is a greater risk of attack\u00a0by gangs on quieter routes. Travel in convoy if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Take care around ATMs, petrol station forecourts, the airport, bus stations and shopping centres.</p>\n\n<p>You can get up-to-date security information from <abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr>\u2019s tourist assistance and emergency service, <abbr title=\"Programa Nacional de Asistencia al Turista\">PROATUR</abbr>, will accompany individual tourists or groups travelling in Guatemala if requested (see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/getting-help\">Getting help</a>).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coaches\">Buses and coaches</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). There has been an increase in armed attacks by local gangs on bus drivers and conductors, often resulting in serious injury or death. These attacks have included the use of explosives. There have also been violent muggings, rapes and assaults against foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Private intercity coach services are generally safer, but gangs have also attacked these during daylight hours, even on main roads.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atm-tampering\">ATM tampering</h3>\n\n<p>Check ATMs for evidence of tampering. Affected machines may not be easy to spot. It\u2019s safer to change money in hotels, at banks or at foreign exchange offices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bogus-police-officers\">Bogus police officers</h3>\n\n<p>Criminals posing as police officers have committed theft, extortion and sexual assault against visitors to Guatemala.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors are at risk of scams. Scams come in many forms and can lead to great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they\u2019re asked to transfer funds to you in Guatemala. Tell them to contact you to check that you\u2019ve made this request.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to always carry ID. In most parts of the country, you can carry a copy of your passport\u2019s photo page for identification purposes. In San Pedro La Laguna, Solol\u00e1, local authorities may not accept a copy and may fine or detain you if you cannot show your original passport or a certified copy. Always co-operate with military and police officers and be prepared for checkpoints.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to sell alcoholic and fermented beverages from 1am to 6am.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug trafficking and use. Guatemalan prisons are overcrowded, violent and dirty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-photos-without-permission\">Taking photos without permission</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs without permission, especially of children. This is particularly important in more remote areas such as Quich\u00e9, Pet\u00e9n, San Marcos and Chiquimula provinces. There have been attacks related to accusations and fears of child kidnapping for adoption or theft of vital organs. Foreigners have been caught up in the violence. You may need to pay a small amount of money to take photographs of both children and adults.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality\u00a0is not illegal, although there are no laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Guatemala. In Guatemala City, local people are largely tolerant of different lifestyles. Outside Guatemala City, attitudes are more conservative. Showing affection in public may bring verbal and physical attacks, harassment and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You\u00a0can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Guatemala for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-rules-and-safety\">Driving rules and safety</h3>\n\n<p>In Guatemala:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>it is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving</li>\n  <li>speed limits are strictly enforced</li>\n  <li>motorcyclists must wear an orange vest and helmet with the registration number or face a fine of 1,000 Guatemalan quetzal (around \u00a3100)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine, your licence confiscated and possible imprisonment. However, drinking-driving is common in Guatemala.</p>\n\n<p>In more isolated locations, roads are unpaved and you may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident, contact the National Police (telephone: 110) or the fire brigade (telephone: 122 or 123\u00a0) and wait for them to arrive. PROVIAL (telephone: +502 2419 2121 or 1520), a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major roads in the country. However, patrols are infrequent.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on road laws, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transito.gob.gt/legislacion-en-materia-de-transito/\">Guatemala Department of Transport</a>\u00a0(in Spanish).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"intercity-buses\">Intercity buses</h3>\n\n<p>Guatemala Municipality no longer allows some intercity buses to enter the city centre.

Check that your flight has been confirmed the afternoon before you are due to fly. In bad weather, check your flight is going ahead before you travel to the airport.</p>\n\n<p>LATAM normally operates weekly scheduled air services to Mount Pleasant Airport on the Falkland Islands, from Chile and Brazil. Both commercial services were suspended due to COVID-19.  The service to Chile recommenced on 2 July 2022.  The service linking the Falkland Islands with Brazil remains suspended. Check with LATAM in advance for up to date information on air services.</p>\n\n<p>The RAF operates a fare-paying service from RAF Brize Norton to Mount Pleasant Airport in the UK, twice weekly. This flight also stops in Ascension Island.</p>\n\n<p>This service can be subject to delays due to poor weather, especially during the southern hemisphere winter. Total journey time is approximately 18 hours .

Speed limits are 25mph in the Stanley area and 40mph on other roads.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the condition of most roads, and the strong winds, you should take great care when driving outside Stanley, especially on the road between Mount Pleasant Airport and Stanley.

If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>For a longer stay (to work or study, for business or for other reasons) you will need to meet the Greek government\u2019s entry requirements. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/the-embassy\">Check with the Greek Embassy</a> before you make arrangements to travel about what type of visa and work permit, if any, you may need.</p>\n\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-greece-for-work\">travelling to Greece for work</a>, read the guidance on visas and permits.</p>\n\n<p>The entry requirements for touring creatives have recently changed, more  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/visa.html?mission=lon\">details of the new rules can be found on the Greek Embassy website.</a> If you stay in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-stamping\">Passport stamping</h3>\n\n<p>Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Greece as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you\u2019re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you do overstay, you may be fined on departure, and have restrictions placed on your ability to re-enter Greece whilst the fine remains unpaid.</p>\n\n<p>You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.</p>\n\n<p>You may also need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>\n  <li>show you have enough money for your stay</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are resident in Greece, read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece#passports-and-travel\">Living in Greece guide</a> for passport stamping information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/91/greece\">check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.aade.gr/en/customs\">goods that can be brought into and taken out of Greece</a>.

Stay aware of your surroundings, stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"strikes-and-demonstrations\">Strikes and demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>There are regular strikes, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders. Political demonstrations can also occur frequently.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent. If you do find yourself unexpectedly near a demonstration, move away to the last known safe place. Security forces often use tear gas to break up demonstrations, which can harm your breathing and vision.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations take place regularly around major squares in central Athens, in particular Syntagma Square. There is currently a heightened risk of demonstrations, particularly in central Athens, related to events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Nationwide strikes and protests can occur at any time and may disrupt road, air, sea travel and cause delays or diversions at border crossings.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations may happen at short notice, and have traditionally happened on 1 May, 17 November and 6 December.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"theft\">Theft</h3>\n\n<p>Theft of passports, wallets and handbags are common on the metro and in crowded tourist places, particularly in central Athens. Don\u2019t carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe.       Maintain the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>When driving on holiday, keep your valuables out of sight and lock your vehicle at all times. Always park in a well-lit area or secure car park. Be alert to car crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults and personal attacks may occur in Greece. This includes attacks on foreign visitors in tourist areas and cities.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend that all travellers  follow this advice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it\u2019s easier to find at the end of the night</li>\n  <li>set up a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with others in your group</li>\n  <li>keep an eye on each other\u2019s drinks to make sure they don\u2019t get spiked</li>\n  <li>don\u2019t let a friend walk back to their hotel alone</li>\n  <li>don\u2019t give a drunk person more alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should immediately report anything you see that doesn\u2019t feel right to local authorities or hospitality management.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry a copy of your passport or other photographic ID which confirms British nationality at all times, this is a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"race\">Race</h3>\n\n<p>The majority of visitors experience no difficulties related to race, but there have been some racially motivated attacks, particularly in inner-city areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h3>\n\n<p>The Greek police won\u2019t accept behaviour they find  rowdy or indecent, especially where excessive drinking is involved, this behaviour may be illegal. The police will make arrests and the courts are likely to give heavy fines or prison sentences if you behave indecently.</p>\n\n<p>Some fancy dress costumes may be regarded as offensive and therefore against decency laws. Your travel insurance may not cover you after drinking.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking\">Smoking</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to smoke in all indoor public places. The penalty for violating this law is a fine of up to 500 euros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs can lead to a long prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.</p>\n\n<p>Nitrous oxide is illegal to buy or sell for recreational use in Greece. You can be arrested or fined if found in possession.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s sometimes necessary to time stamp or validate your ticket on public transport for it to be valid. Check with local providers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-goods-or-services\">Buying goods or services</h3>\n\n<p>Make sure you get a receipt for any goods or services you buy.</p>\n\n<p>Offensive items like pepper spray, knuckledusters or knives with a blade length of 10cm or above are listed as weapons in Greece and fall under the current weapon possession law. You need to have a special licence from the local police authority to carry any weapon otherwise you might face arrest and legal charges. You need to have a special licence to carry any knife that is not made for domestic, professional, artistic or hunting use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual relations are legal in Greece and civil unions between same-sex couples have been legal since 2015.  The age of consent in Greece is 15, this applies to partners of both the same sex and opposite sex.  Transgender people are able to change their legal gender.  Anti-discrimination and hate speech laws apply to gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards same-sex sexual activity vary throughout the country; showing affection in public by same-sex couples may be frowned upon, especially in rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes are generally much more welcoming in Athens and on many Greek islands, particularly on Lesvos, Mykonos and Skiathos.  See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"military-service\">Military service</h3>\n\n<p>Men, aged 19 and above, born to a Greek national parent may have military service obligations, regardless of any other nationality they hold. Authorities can prevent you leaving Greece until you complete military service obligations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-or-approaching-sensitive-locations\">Using cameras or approaching sensitive locations</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to approach or take photos or videos of military installations, vehicles or buildings at any time. The Greek authorities will arrest and possibly prosecute anyone doing so. Certain border areas are also militarily sensitive. Although you can visit these areas, you should avoid taking photos or video footage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"music-festivals\">Music festivals</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of local laws and customs, and take extra care of your valuables if attending a festival or large concert. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/festival-travel-checklist\">Read our festivals in Europe travel checklist</a> for more advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports-and-swimming-safety\">Water sports and swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>If you are considering taking part in water sports activities, do so through a licensed water sports centre and make sure paperwork is completed before starting the activity. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://safewatersports.com/\">Safe Water Sports website</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you follow any warning signs, adhere to instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches. Follow local advice if jellyfish or urchins are present.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quad-biking-and-mopeds\">Quad biking and mopeds</h3>\n\n<p>Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential.  Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.</p>\n\n<p>If you do rent a quad bike, choose a category in accordance with your driving licence and age. Drivers and passengers must wear helmets. Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance and if stopped you will be fined and your licence taken from you. If you intend to hire a moped you will need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - \u2018light motorcycle\u2019. Category P, which is valid in the UK for driving mopeds up to 50cc, is not valid in Greece.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Greece, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/greece/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you\u2019re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic can be busy, fast and chaotic, especially in the larger cities. Take care when crossing roads. Pedestrians should cross roads using a crossing. Drivers don\u2019t always stop, even though they are required to. The green pedestrian crossing signal sometimes also allows cars to turn right onto the crossing, so cross with caution.</p>\n\n<p>Driving any vehicle while over the legal drinking limit can result in a heavy fine or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Greece with a UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">GOV.UK displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n<p>Adverse weather conditions, including floods, are affecting some regions.\u00a0 The situation can change quickly.

If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.

You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Health facilities in Palau are adequate for routine medical care, but limited in availability and quality. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.</p>\n\n<p>The only national hospital is \u2018Belau National Hospital\u2019, in Koror, which can generally be reached in less than two hours from most locations. The hospital has the only hyperbaric chamber in Palau, an operating suite, dialysis machines and an outpatient clinic.

Emergency treatment or treatment for serious conditions is limited and so you may be medically evacuated to another country.

You may wish to compare each option to decide which route is more appropriate to your personal needs and circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The first option is to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) in the UK from a UK Post Office. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Once in Taiwan, you will need to take your passport, IDP and a passport photograph to a local Motor Vehicles Office to get your IDP validated. This option has the shortest and simplest procedure and can be completed on the same day. Your validated IDP will only last up to 12 months, and a new IDP needs to be obtained and validated thereafter to continue driving in Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>The second option is to exchange your UK driving licence for a Taiwanese licence at your local Motor Vehicles Office using the Licence Exchange Arrangement. Your Taiwan licence will expire 6 years from the date of issue. You will need to provide the relevant supporting documents and, in line with UK legislation, your existing UK licence will be returned to the DVLA by the Taiwanese authorities when you apply. You will be able to drive in the UK with your Taiwan licence as a visitor for up to 12 months each time you enter the UK. If you plan to return to the UK to live, you will be able to exchange your Taiwan licence for your UK licence. Please note that British Office Taipei cannot provide support on individual applications. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-taiwan\">Visit our Living in Taiwan page</a> for application guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The third option is to take a local driving test to obtain a Taiwan driving licence, while retaining your existing UK licence. This option requires more time commitment, but long-term UK residents in Taiwan may wish to consider this option. Do not drive a vehicle without a valid licence.</p>\n\n<p>The alcohol limit for drivers in Taiwan is lower than in the UK. The current legal limit is 0.15 micrograms of alcohol per 1000 millilitres of breath or 0.03% blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Driving while over the limit can result in heavy fines and imprisonment. Passengers may also be fined.</p>\n\n<p>Roads and vehicles are well-maintained but scooters and motorcycles often weave in and out of traffic. Be alert when crossing roads as vehicles might not stop at pedestrian crossings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"advance-fee-frauds\">Advance fee frauds</h3>\n\n<p>Individuals and companies in the UK (and elsewhere) often receive letters, faxes and e-mails, offering them large sums of money provided they send various \u2018advance fees\u2019 to Taiwanese bank accounts. Fraudsters obtain contact details from telephone or commercial directories, so recipients are not being specifically targeted.</p>\n\n<p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigates advance fee frauds in the UK.  Do not reply to these types of communication. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/\">NCA website</a> contains more information on this type of fraud.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n<p>The UK does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The British Assistance and Services Section of the <a href=\"/government/world/organisations/british-office-taipei\">British Office Taipei</a> can provide certain limited consular assistance. In cases of genuine emergency, the British Office may be able to issue you with an emergency travel document.</p>\n",

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

They have used fake police ID cards, uniforms and even police stations to fool victims. One of the criminals pretends to be a friendly tourist. A fake police officer then approaches and asks for passports and other information. The impostors persuade the victim to get into a taxi driven by another criminal, where they rob them, sometimes by taking them to ATMs to withdraw money.</p>\n\n<p>Call the Tourist Police on 800-14-0081 (toll-free) if you suspect impostors are targeting you.

There are harsh penalties for those caught trafficking or in possession. The minimum sentence is 8 years and prison conditions are very poor. Never leave luggage unattended when departing the country and avoid any contact with illegal drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ayahuasca-ceremonies\">Ayahuasca ceremonies</h3>\n\n<p>Ayahuasca is a traditional plant used in \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019 ceremonies by indigenous communities in Bolivia, primarily in the Amazon region, but also near La Paz. At these ceremonies people consume a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogenic drug. It is not illegal to consume this brew, but its interaction with existing medical conditions is not well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after consuming it. Some Ayahuasca retreats are in remote areas, making it difficult to get medical help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-remote-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in remote areas</h3>\n\n<p>Be careful travelling with cameras and binoculars in remote areas, particularly in coca-growing areas such as the Chapare and the Yungas, where people can be suspicious of anyone taking photographs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check before taking photographs of local people.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal. However, same-sex relationships are frowned on by many Bolivians, more so in the Altiplano than in Santa Cruz, where attitudes tend to be more liberal.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Adventure activities in Bolivia include mountain biking, salt flat tours and jungle expeditions. There are no official minimum standards for tour operators. Get local advice and only use reputable\u00a0companies. Check your travel insurance policy covers you for the activities you\u2019re planning.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re mountain biking on the so-called \u2018Death Road\u2019, from La Paz to Coroico through the Yungas Valley, make sure the bikes are in good condition. Check your guide is carrying safety equipment and first-aid kit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Bolivia, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have both a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car to drive in Bolivia. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit\">find your nearest post office branch that offers this service</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel can be dangerous due to poor road conditions and low driving standards. Serious accidents happen on the main tourist routes. Some of Bolivia\u2019s main highways are paved but most roads are unpaved rough tracks.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (November to March) there is a risk of landslides and roads can be blocked. Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/\">road status updates from the Bolivian road authority</a> (in Spanish) and get local advice before you set out.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles are often not well maintained. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often needed, especially during the rainy season. Broken-down vehicles with no warning lights are a frequent hazard on roads at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-taxis\">Buses and taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Several recent accidents involving public transport, especially long-distance buses, have affected British people. Bus drivers drive for longer than would be permitted under European laws.</p>\n\n<p>Many taxis and most bus companies do not meet European standards and rarely have seatbelts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-blockades\">Road blockades</h3>\n\n<p>Groups often use road blockades as a form of protest, without warning. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and do not attempt to cross blockades. Blockades can disrupt public transport at very short notice. Strikes may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from airports. Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/\">road status updates from the Bolivian road authority</a> (in Spanish) to see which roads are blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Many of Bolivia\u2019s airports lack safety and rescue capability. Airports outside the departmental capitals are less likely to possess fire and rescue equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-and-river-travel\">Lake and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>The boat trips on Lake Titicaca offer boats that are often very basic. The same is true of boats used for river excursions in jungle areas. Check life jackets are provided.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding-and-landslides\">Flooding and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>Floods and landslides are common, particularly in mountainous areas during the rainy season (November to March). Roads are often impassable for days at a time.</p>\n\n",

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n<p>Liberia has become increasingly stable since the internal conflict ended in 2003. The Liberian government is working closely with the UN and the international community to provide increased stability and development.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations do take place on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Liberia\u2019s general and Presidential elections take place on 10 October and the electoral process could last for several weeks. Avoid political gatherings or demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations and rallies can be unpredictable and may turn violent. You should exercise a high degree of caution and monitor local media for developments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Liberia are incident free but there is a high level of crime in Monrovia, including armed robbery. Foreigners are occasionally targeted, although Liberians are the main victims of crime. The Liberian National Police has very limited capability to prevent or detect crime, or to provide emergency response in any part of the country. Levels of crime are much higher after dark. Don\u2019t walk anywhere in the city at night.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking alone and only do so during daylight hours.  Avoid areas where there are few people, such as beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is opportunistic theft, but there are organised criminal gangs. Thieves are often armed with knives or machetes, but occasionally also carry firearms. While Liberians are the main victims of crime, the relative wealth of international visitors makes them an attractive target for criminals. Avoid carrying valuables or large sums of money in public and be vigilant at all times, especially at night. Mobile phones and laptops are common targets of theft.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners have been mugged in the Mamba Point and Sinkor areas of Monrovia (including Sinkor beach in broad daylight), where most international visitors stay. Be wary if you are approached by strangers. Criminals also operate in nightclubs and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation occupied by international workers has occasionally been targeted by burglars. Thefts have occurred in taxis. You should avoid local public transport. There is a high incidence of rape in Liberia. There have been cases of rapes and attempted rapes involving foreign women although these are rare.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving in heavy traffic or off the main roads.</p>\n\n<p>Consider your security arrangements carefully before your arrival in Liberia. Stay only in reputable accommodation with adequate guarding and other security arrangements, and arrange for transport, including travel to and from the airport in advance. Roberts International Airport is around 30 miles from central Monrovia, much of the journey passing through rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local Travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes clashes between armed groups from both sides of the Liberian/Cote d\u2019Ivoire border in some of the more remote border areas of Grand Gedeh and River Gee counties. To avoid straying into these areas, use the main roads when travelling in these counties.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the national authorities to provide emergency help outside Monrovia is limited. Check the security situation before travelling to any part of the country. Violent incidents, particularly in rural areas, are possible as a result of land disputes, illegal mining and occupation of rubber plantations. Organised groups of former combatants may be present in areas of the country where there is limited government security presence, including Sinoe rubber plantation and Sapo National Park.</p>\n\n<p>The Samuel K Doe Stadium in Monrovia can become overcrowded during major football matches or events.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h3>\n\n<p>An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. A temporary local licence may be obtained on production of a UK licence, but this may be time consuming and more expensive. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Liberia after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The roads from Monrovia to  the port town of Buchanan and to the border with Sierra Leone at Bo Waterside, and to the border with Guinea at Ganta, are mainly paved and in reasonable condition. However, the road from Monrovia to Roberts International Airport is currently undergoing roadworks and can be hazardous, and most other roads outside Monrovia are unpaved. Driving and road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season (May to November), and many roads may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport (but with care due to ongoing roadworks). Roads are treacherous and all roads are unlit. Vehicles often do not have lights. You are more vulnerable to being robbed at an illegal check point at night.</p>\n\n<p>Make precautionary arrangements for dealing with breakdowns, including considering travel with more than one vehicle. Traffic accidents can quickly draw hostile crowds, who may attempt to take justice into their own hands. Use a local driver outside Monrovia rather than driving yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is generally poor. Be particularly alert to dangers from other vehicles swerving to avoid potholes and from taxis slowing or stopping unpredictably to pick up or drop off passengers and motorcycle taxis \u2018Pein-Peins\u2019 (the main cause of road accidents). Motorcycle taxis are very dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared to stop at checkpoints operated by the Liberian National Police, or other Liberian security authorities, which are found on roads throughout the country. Pull over to the side of the road immediately when instructed by security forces accompanying VIP convoys.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air Travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travellers should be aware that all Liberia-certified air carriers are included on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/media/5fwfpd4s/uk-asl-april-2022-updated-002.pdf\">UK Air Safety List (ASL).</a></p>\n\n<p>The UK Air Safety List identifies foreign airlines which do not fulfil the necessary international safety standards, and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to help UK travellers to make informed decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas, including on domestic flights. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of the UK Air Safety List when considering which carriers to fly with. The list is maintained by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and Sea Travel</h3>\n<p>Liberia has many attractive beaches, but the Atlantic Ocean is subject to rip tides and other dangerous currents. Swimmers should take care and seek local advice before entering the water. Avoid canoes and fishing boats offering passenger services. They are regularly overwhelmed by strong waves and currents.</p>\n\n",

Further information on Ebola can be found on the WHO website and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#current-incidents-and-outbreaks\">Public Health England (PHE) website</a>.\nPublic Health England has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ebola-virus-disease-information-for-workers-in-at-risk-countries\">guidance for humanitarian or healthcare workers</a> travelling to countries at risk of Ebola.</p>\n\n<p>Cholera and malaria are present in Liberia and have similar early symptoms to Ebola. You should check this travel advice before travelling to Liberia and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ebola-virus/Pages/Ebola-virus.aspx\">follow the health advice on the NHS website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of Lassa fever in Liberia, with several confirmed cases occurring this year.  For more information on Lassa fever, you should visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/128/liberia#CIoutBreaks\">NaTHNaC</a> website.  If you\u2019re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>The 2012 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 18,000 adults aged 15 or over in Liberia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 0.9% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. \u00a0You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-medical-care\">Local medical care</h3>\n\n<p>Hospitals and medical facilities throughout Liberia are poorly equipped. There are no emergency services. Blood supplies are unreliable and unsafe, and medication is scarce. There is no effective public or commercial accident and emergency or ambulance service anywhere in the country. You should carry basic medical supplies. Medication is usually sold over the counter in pharmacies, without a prescription. However, supplies can be unreliable and medications available in the UK may not be available in Liberia. Ensure you have adequate supplies of prescription medication, bearing in mind the risk of delays due to flight cancellations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation. Most health care providers only accept cash payments.</p>\n\n<p>Previous increases in serious COVID-19 cases caused Liberian healthcare facilities to experience severe capacity constraints. There was a lack of oxygen, medication, personal protective equipment and critical care beds. There were reports that accident victims with serious injuries were turned away from hospitals, and that patients experiencing respiratory distress died due to lack of oxygen. Although confirmed COVID-19 cases have now reduced, they could increase again. You should consider the significant health risks before travelling to Liberia.</p>\n\n<p>For contact details for English speaking doctors <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liberia-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners\">visit our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>\n",

Several cash machines/ATMs accepting only Visa cards now operate in Monrovia, including in the two main hotels frequented by international visitors, but ATMs frequently run out of cash. Foreign exchange and banking facilities are limited. Western Union and Moneygram have a number of agents in Liberia who are able to transfer money from the UK, although there are very few outside Monrovia.

Banks and foreign exchange facilities may be unable to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient funds, in US dollars cash, to cover all expenses.

You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. If in doubt seek prior permission from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.gov.ua/en/contacts\">customs authorities</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-your-car-to-ukraine\">Bringing your car to Ukraine</h3>\n\n<p>Non-residents are allowed to bring a vehicle for personal use into Ukraine for up to one year. There\u2019s no need to complete a customs declaration form. The vehicle can only be used in Ukraine by the person that brought it into the country. The vehicle cannot be used for commercial purposes, dismantled, sold or rented to other people. If you want to do any of these things, you\u2019ll need to register the vehicle in Ukraine and pay the appropriate customs tax.</p>\n\n<p>You must take the vehicle out of Ukraine within the required timeframe, or place it into the customs regime of the State.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed, you should inform the State Customs Service and provide them with evidence that it cannot be repaired. You may then dispose of the vehicle through the official channels of the State Customs Service.</p>\n\n<p>If you bring a private vehicle into Ukraine with the intention of travelling through the country, you may be asked to complete a customs declaration form and pay a deposit.</p>\n\n<p>For further information on bringing your car to Ukraine, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.gov.ua/contacts\">contact the State Customs Service of Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crossing-international-borders\">Crossing international borders</h2>\n\n<p>It is illegal to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that is not currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. There is a real risk to life.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the war, your activities may amount to offences under UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK. British nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured. British nationals undertaking humanitarian work have also been detained by Russian authorities. The risk to life, or of mistreatment, is high. Our ability to provide consular support in these circumstances is very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of the Ukrainian authorities while you remain in Ukraine. Check the rules of martial law in your location. These will vary from region to region. Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks, including the impact of the invasion in your area. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Take extra care while moving around.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you know what curfews are in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Before the invasion, serious crime against foreigners was relatively rare, but incidents did occur, with some cases being racially motivated.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of crime, report it to the police by calling 102.  <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-list-of-interpreters\">a list of local translators in Ukraine</a>. We cannot confirm whether these translators are still offering services during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of and from vehicles is common. Do not leave documents or money in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Cloning of credit and debit cards is common. Be aware of who is around you when using ATMs and do not let your card out of your sight during transactions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times to use as identification and to demonstrate your legal status in Ukraine if asked by the police. Police should identify themselves and show identification. If you\u2019re detained because you have not been able to present your passport, ask for an official report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-to-money\">Access to money</h3>\n\n<p>ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used in cities. However, as a result of the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia, ATMs might not be refilled with cash and some bank cards might not be accepted. Make sure you have sufficient cash in local currency. US dollars and euros are the easiest currencies to exchange in Ukraine. You may be able to exchange sterling, but in fewer places. Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not accepted. Only use official exchange booths and make sure you\u2019re given a receipt. You\u2019ll need to present your passport to exchange currency worth 150,000 Ukrainian hryvnia or more. You\u2019ll need the receipt to exchange money back on departure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-and-smoking\">Alcohol and smoking</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to smoke or drink alcohol in public places, including on public transport, at bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs near government or military establishments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Although same-sex relationships are not illegal, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and showing affection in public may receive negative attention. There\u2019s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h2>\n\n<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) advises against all travel to Ukraine. Because of security challenges in Ukraine, we currently advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements there.</p>\n\n<p>Children born through surrogacy are not automatically entitled to British nationality and therefore a British travel document. We cannot confirm which Ukrainian lawyers are offering services, due to the ongoing invasion.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine. Plan appropriately for the time you will need to spend in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement with a Ukrainian woman in another country, you should read about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas/surrogacy-overseas\">surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A surrogacy arrangement in a country near Ukraine must comply with the law of that country, not Ukrainian law. In some other countries, surrogacy arrangements may, in certain circumstances, be illegal.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly advise you to seek specialist independent UK and in-country legal advice before changing arrangements.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-information-and-risks\">Transport information and risks</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expect disruption to travel and transport networks. Only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. We cannot confirm which services below are operating. Where possible, check before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Ukraine, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/ukraine/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Roads are of variable quality and routes may be affected by the ongoing invasion. Avoid night-time travel wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Local driving standards are poor. Street lights are weak and speed limits, traffic lights and road signs are often ignored. Drivers frequently do not indicate before manoeuvring. There are a high number of traffic accidents, including fatalities. Speeding, drink driving and infrequent use of helmets, seat belts and child restraints in vehicles are the main contributing factors.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a road accident, you must wait for the police to assess the accident. Call the police on 102. Local officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>You must wear a seat belt.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive with any alcohol content in your blood.</p>\n\n<p>Police can stop vehicles and give fines for minor offences such as illegal parking or jumping a red light. They may carry a credit card terminal to collect payment on the spot, or fines can be paid online or at a bank within 15 days. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://police.kiev.ua/statti/203-yak-splatiti-shtraf-pdr\">payment options</a> (in Ukrainian). The police officer should give their name and rank, explain why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report. The police may film interactions with members of the public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You must have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well as your UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Ukraine. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>You need to carry a green card to drive in Ukraine. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry original vehicle registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers at all times. You must show them when crossing borders and if you are stopped by the police. This also applies to rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire</h3>\n\n<p>If you intend to rent a vehicle for your travel in Ukraine, check with the car hire company and insurance company about their policy on renting cars in Ukraine and any other country you will pass through, especially non-EU countries. Ensure they provide you with a rental agreement permitting you to cross the Ukrainian border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leaving-ukraine-by-car\">Leaving Ukraine by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can leave Ukraine by car through most border crossing points, but Ukraine\u2019s border crossings with Russia and Belarus are closed to regular traffic.</p>\n\n<p>There could be long queues at the border crossing points with EU member states and Moldova. Have a good supply of food, water, warm clothing, medication and fuel.</p>\n\n<p>Check waiting times at border crossings from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/map\">https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/map</a> - Ukrainian Govt.

Some supply chains are interrupted, and some medical products are hard to come by.

The service <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://Tabletki.ua\">Tabletki.ua</a> is continuing to operate and tries to maintain hourly updates about availability of medicines nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies may close without notice. Maintain a stock of essential medication. Pharmacies in smaller towns may not have the same variety of medications available in the bigger cities. Pharmacies are usually easily identifiable by the presence of a green cross or the word \u2018apteka\u2019 (\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430).

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Targets might include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>security forces</li>\n  <li>government offices</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>shops and supermarkets</li>\n  <li>transport infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2019, there were a number of small explosions in Bangkok Satun City, and Phatthalung province in the south of Thailand</li>\n  <li>in 2018, there was a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation can be unpredictable and has led to periods of civil and political unrest.  A general election took place in May and the process of forming a government is ongoing. Avoid protests, political gatherings, demonstrations and marches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police may ask to check your passport. If you do not have it with you, you could be arrested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>Report any crime to the Thai police before you leave Thailand. Your case may not be investigated if you try to report it later.</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities, including the police, may pass details of a crime, including photos, to the media without a person\u2019s consent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially thieves on motorbikes</li>\n  <li>take care when travelling in open transport like tut-tuts</li>\n  <li>keep valuables secure and out of sight</li>\n  <li>avoid sleeping on buses and trains \u2013 people  have had items taken from bags while asleep</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep hold of your passport. Don\u2019t hand it over as a guarantee, for example to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses. Companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves tourists. However several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok in 2018. Take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through isolated areas alone, especially at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks can happen in tourist areas across Thailand. Attacks are most common during full moon parties or similar events, and near bars late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Drink spiking and drug-assisted sexual assault does happen in tourist areas around Thailand, with male and female victims. Do not leave your drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"be-drink-aware\">Be drink aware</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert and less aware of your environment. This can make you more vulnerable to accidents, injuries, robbery and assaults.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of credit card fraud. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming. Use an ATM in a bank and always protect your PIN.</p>\n\n<p>Be wary of job offers that appear too good to be true. People have arrived in Thailand and been illegally transported to neighbouring countries on the promise of high-paying jobs, which turn out to be scams. When you re-enter Thailand you may then be detained while your immigration status is validated.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passports confiscated by scammers</li>\n  <li>victims being held in poor living conditions</li>\n  <li>coercion into undertaking wider online scamming activity</li>\n  <li>pressure to make large payments to be released from sham jobs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention-facilities\">Detention facilities</h3>\n\n<p>Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. Detainees have died in custody.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>You should be aware of differences between UK and Thai law and local customs.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Bangkok has a video on what to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ukinthailand/videos/2132346856805703/\">Facebook \u2013 visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ukinthailand/status/1002378124200329216\">Twitter \u2013 visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticising-the-thai-monarchy\">Criticising the Thai monarchy</h3>\n\n<p>Criticising the Thai monarchy (l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9) is illegal. The law can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. British and Thai journalists, human rights defenders, and members of the public have faced charges for raising concerns, making political comments, sharing articles online that could been seen as negative towards Thailand, or making accusations about individuals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"posting-images-on-social-media\">Posting images on social media</h3>\n\n<p>Posting images on social media of people drinking alcohol or wearing clothing considered inappropriate can be illegal. Both the person who uploaded the images and the people in them could be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>While cigarettes are common, you could be fined up to 5,000 Thai baht for smoking them in public. E-cigarettes are illegal. You could be fined or imprisoned for using them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has strict laws against drug use, possession and trafficking. Possessing small quantities of illegal substances can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment. Possessing <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.siam-legal.com/litigation/criminal-defence-drug-offences-in-thailand.php\">Class A drugs</a> can lead to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Private recreational use of cannabis is legal if the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is below 0.2% by weight. Cannabis use in public places is illegal. The Ministry of Public Health has made it legal to grow, use, distribute and sell cannabis products, but this has not been enshrined in law so some restrictions may remain.

Same-sex marriages are not legally recognised.  Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cites.dnp.go.th/npd_app/npd_cites/homepage/?slg=EN\">without a license</a>. Ivory trade is banned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property-in-thailand\">Buying property in Thailand</h3>\n\n<p>Buying property in Thailand is not straightforward. Make sure you understand local laws and consult a lawyer before making financial commitments. British people have been victims of property scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities\">Outdoor activities</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"elephant-treks\">Elephant treks</h3>\n\n<p>Elephant treks can be dangerous, especially if elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Use a reliable, licensed tour guide. British nationals have been seriously injured and killed because handlers have lost control of the elephant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safely\">Swimming safely</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. People have drowned in strong riptides. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow warning signs, especially red flags</li>\n  <li>only swim from approved beaches, with flags</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Jellyfish stings can be fatal. Take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving\">Diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving schools and rescue service standards are not always as high as in the UK. Check the dive operator\u2019s credentials and make sure you\u2019re covered by your insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve had no previous diving experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up</li>\n  <li>check safety equipment is available on the boat</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check that they have appropriate plans in place for emergencies, including their ability to get assistance to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-traffic-accidents\">Road traffic accidents</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has a high number of road traffic accidents, particularly with motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Thailand as one of the world\u2019s deadliest countries for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/road-safety#tab=tab_1\">fatalities on motorcycles</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licenses-and-permits\">Licenses and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Apply for a Thai driving licence or, if you already hold a UK licence, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, it could invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident or injury.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-and-motorcycle-hire\">Car and motorcycle hire</h3>\n\n<p>Motorcycles and scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and cannot be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Do not hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>\n\n<p>By law, you must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Lots of passenger boat services operate between the mainland and islands. Boats can sink or collide, which has led to fatalities, including of British nationals. Accidents are usually due to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>overloading</li>\n  <li>poor maintenance</li>\n  <li>rough seas, particularly during monsoon season</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"travellers-with-limited-mobility\">Travellers with limited mobility</h2>\n\n<p>Wheelchair access is often limited across Thailand due to uneven paving, obstacles and a lack of facilities such as lifts and ramps. This includes public transport systems. Many taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs.</p>\n\n<p>See FCDO advice on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-for-disabled-people\">disability and travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainy-season\">Rainy season</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season is generally from May to October. In Koh Samui and the south east of Thailand it is from November to March. However, the rainy season has been more unpredictable recently.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy storms cause disruption including flooding and landslides. Lakes, caves and waterfalls are particularly at risk of dangerous flash flooding.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tmd.go.th/en/\">Thai Meteorological Department</a> for weather warnings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes and tremors can happen in Northern Thailand.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://earthquaketrack.com/\">Earthquake Track</a> lists recent activity.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> for what to do in an earthquake.</p>\n",

Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>North Korea\u2019s borders are currently closed, but few British people visit when they are open. Those that do are usually part of an organised tour. If you decide to visit North Korea, follow the advice of your tour group and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your personal safety at risk.</p>\n\n<p>The North Korean authorities have reportedly detained some foreign nationals and denied them access to consular support.</p>\n\n<p>While daily life in the capital city Pyongyang may appear calm, the security situation can change quickly with no advance warning about possible actions by the authorities. This poses significant risks to British visitors and residents.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the political and security situation very closely and stay in touch with your host organisation or tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"current-incidents-and-risks\">Current incidents and risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"covid-19-lockdown\">COVID-19 lockdown</h3>\n\n<p>No entry into North Korea is permitted while COVID-19 border restrictions remain in place. The North Korean government continues to temporarily suspend all passenger routes into and out of North Korea. The British Embassy in Pyongyang is temporarily closed due to these restrictions. This means you cannot get consular support from within North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot enter or leave North Korea through the border with South Korea without special permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nuclear-testing\">Nuclear testing</h3>\n\n<p>The level of tension on the Korean peninsula has remained high since 2017 when North Korea began a series of nuclear and missile tests.</p>\n\n<p>A halt in nuclear testing and ballistic missile tests, announced in April 2018, came to an end in May 2019.

If you\u2019re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (<abbr title=\"Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\">DPRK</abbr>)    in London  by email at <a href=\"mailto:prkinfo@yahoo.com\">prkinfo@yahoo.com</a>, or by telephone on 020 8992 4965 .</p>\n\n<p>Tourists can normally only travel to North Korea as part of an organised tour. Independent travellers will need a sponsor and permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is usually only possible for business travellers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19-rules\">COVID-19 rules</h2>\n\n<p>No entry into North Korea is permitted whilst COVID-19 border restrictions remain in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You will need a visa to enter North Korea.

Most hotels will automatically complete this process on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Some hotels may insist on full cash payment in advance when you check in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>You must leave any Global Positioning System technology with North Korean customs. You can collect your devices when you leave North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>You can bring a foreign mobile phone into the country, but you must register it at the border. You can only use it with a North Korean SIM card.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid bringing books or other written material in the Korean language, including anything with religious content. Consider carefully any films or television programmes that you bring into the country, either on DVD or on data storage devices. Any literature or media deemed to have an anti-government message or deemed subversive or pornographic by the authorities in North Korea risk confiscation, with severe penalties including imprisonment as a result.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been cases of travel guides being confiscated at the airport on arrival; they are usually returned on departure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-money-into-north-korea\">Taking money into North Korea</h2>\n\n<p>Shops and restaurants list prices in the local currency (North Korean won) but usually charge foreigners in foreign currency. They convert the won price using official exchange rates.</p>\n\n<p>The euro and US dollar are the most widely accepted currencies, although some places accept Chinese yuan.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import and export the local currency. There are no restrictions on importing and exporting foreign currency, but you must declare it at customs. Credit cards and travellers cheques are not accepted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n",

A halt in nuclear testing and ballistic missile tests, announced in April 2018, came to an end in May 2019, when the North and South Korean governments temporarily restored direct contact. North Korea and the United States also restored contact at this time.</p>\n\n<p>North Korea resumed missile tests in 2019, after the breakdown of the Hanoi Summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un. North Korea has tested ballistic missiles frequently since 2019.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, similar periods of diplomatic engagement have not lasted. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests and a return to instability in the region. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises, often held in the spring and autumn.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime against foreigners in North Korea is rare. Take sensible precautions to protect your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fire-safety\">Fire safety</h2>\n\n<p>Levels of fire safety awareness may be low. You may wish to check hotel fire procedures or consult your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Insults or jokes about the North Korean political system and its leadership are severely frowned upon. Foreigners have sometimes found themselves in trouble for not paying what was deemed to be a sufficient level of respect, including not treating images of the leader with care.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the North Korean authorities have arrested some visitors on various or unspecified grounds, including 4 US citizens and 1 Canadian. Some have faced public trials.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016 a US national was sentenced to 15 years hard labour after a conviction for crimes against the state. He was found to have attempted to steal a political banner from the staff quarters of a tourist hotel. When he was released in 2017, he was in a coma and died soon after his return to the US.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h2>\n\n<p>Offences that would be considered trivial in other countries can incur very severe penalties in North Korea, particularly actions the authorities deem to be disrespectful towards the North Korean leadership or government.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>Ask permission before taking photographs. Avoid taking photographs of North Korean officials or guarded buildings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no specific legislation outlawing same sex relationships in North Korea, these are considered unacceptable by the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-outside-pyongyang\">Travel outside Pyongyang</h2>\n\n<p>Foreigners living in Pyongyang are usually able to travel within the city, but will often require permission for travel outside Pyongyang.</p>\n\n<p>Travel for visitors within North Korea is severely restricted. Whether you are visiting on business or as a tourist, a guide will almost always accompany you. The guide will decide where you can go. It is your guide\u2019s responsibility to get permission to travel outside Pyongyang. Military checkpoints at the entry and exit to all towns usually include ID checks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 guards shot and killed a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted military area. Remain in permitted areas and move away immediately if asked to do so by North Korean officials.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can get taxis from hotels or outside department stores, but they will be reluctant to take you without a local guide or interpreter. Foreigners are not generally allowed on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>International driving permits are not valid in North Korea. Foreigners living in North Korea must get a local driving licence by passing a local driving test. You should take extra care when driving, as roads are often of poor quality with frequent hazards, and pedestrian road safety awareness is low.</p>\n\n<p>See more information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Most travellers enter North Korea on direct flights from Beijing to Pyongyang operated by the North Korean national airline Air Koryo or Air China.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fuk-air-safety-list&amp;data=05%7C01%7CFlora.Death%40fcdo.gov.uk%7Ca453c874a6bd49fe7d3608db5522f725%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C638197381224386573%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RT1Kf6OhMx9SCkt5sDIj4jc6%2BYEpJtla4x%2BAGUNjiCM%3D&amp;reserved=0\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) has banned Air Koryo from operating commercial air services to the UK, with the exception of 2 Tupolev Tu204 aircraft.

Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorists may target places visited by larger groups, including foreigners, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>restaurants, hotels, bars and markets</li>\n  <li>stations and airports</li>\n  <li>places of worship and tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>festivals, sports venues and beaches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stay alert, especially in public places</li>\n  <li>check local media for warnings before you travel</li>\n  <li>report unattended baggage quickly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Republic Day (26 January)</li>\n  <li>Independence Day (15 August)</li>\n  <li>Diwali (usually in October or November)</li>\n  <li>Eid (date changes each year)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Terrorist and insurgent groups include Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) and Naxalite groups.

Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has also previously targeted India.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"regions-with-heightened-risk\">Regions with heightened risk</h4>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jammu and Kashmir, and less often in some parts of north-east India</li>\n  <li>rural areas of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha</li>\n  <li>parts of Bihar and West Bengal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/india/regional-risks\">regional risks for more information</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Strikes (sometimes referred to as \u2018bandh\u2019 or \u2018hartal\u2019), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company</li>\n  <li>monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.</p>\n\n<p>India\u2019s Women Helpline Number is 1091.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.</p>\n\n<p>Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad.\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.</p>\n\n<p>It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.</p>\n\n<p>In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.</p>\n\n<p>There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.</p>\n\n<p>The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bihar</li>\n  <li>Gujarat</li>\n  <li>Mizoram</li>\n  <li>Nagaland</li>\n  <li>the region of Lakshadweep</li>\n  <li>Manipur</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.</p>\n\n<p>E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking-in-india\">Trekking in India</h3>\n\n<p>Trekkers should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in groups</li>\n  <li>use reputable local guides and stay on established routes</li>\n  <li>check if you need any special permits</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Leave details of where you\u2019re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation.

In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.</p>\n\n<p>Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-custody-and-family-law\">Child custody and family law</h3>\n\n<p>Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers\">consult a local lawyer</a> to find out more about the relevant laws.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you\u2019re caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-offences-against-children\">Sexual offences against children</h3>\n\n<p>The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-in-india\">Transport risks in India</h2>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-rickshaws\">Taxis and rickshaws</h3>\n\n<p>When using taxis or rickshaws:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night</li>\n  <li>use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers.

Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic hazards include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reckless driving and manoeuvring</li>\n  <li>poorly maintained vehicles</li>\n  <li>poor quality and congested roads</li>\n  <li>roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock</li>\n  <li>vehicles running red lights</li>\n  <li>protests - see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security#political-situation\">our advice on the Political Situation</a> in India</li>\n  <li>extreme weather and natural disasters - see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security#extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">our advice on Extreme weather</a> in India</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-in-india\">Driving in India</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in India, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit</a> after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.</p>\n\n<p>Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.</p>\n\n<p>Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks.\u00a0 Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling by train:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not accept food or drinks from strangers</li>\n  <li>thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables</li>\n  <li>avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Although piracy has not so far affected India\u2019s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.</p>\n\n<p>Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.</p>\n\n<p>Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster.\u00a0 Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.

There is a heavy security presence. Curfews and other restrictions can be imposed and lifted frequently and quickly. Stay vigilant, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners are vulnerable in rural districts and outside the main population centres and tourist areas. There is a risk of unpredictable violence, including bombings, grenade attacks, shootings and kidnapping. The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers.

Curfews and other restrictions have been imposed in many parts of the state. There may be transport disruptions. Mobile internet services remain suspended.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid protests or large gatherings</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company</li>\n  <li>monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you decide that it is essential to travel to Imphal and the surrounding Imphal Valley areas, then only travel by air after checking the latest security conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of terrorism and organised crime in Manipur, especially in rural areas. Although foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can be indiscriminate.</p>\n\n<p>Some insurgent groups are active in north-east India. During 2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>violent clashes along the disputed border between Assam and Mizoram led to deaths</li>\n  <li>violent communal and political clashes were reported in Tripura</li>\n  <li>a number of civilians were killed by security forces in Nagaland near the Myanmar border</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been skirmishes on the India-Bangladesh border. Travellers are advised to check with local authorities before visiting these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and large gatherings are common in India\u2019s north-eastern states. They can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder. Avoid protests and leave as soon as possible if a crowd develops. Review your security arrangements carefully and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Permits from the Government of India are needed for travel to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sikkimtourism.gov.in/Public/index\">Sikkim</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.arunachaltourism.com/\">Arunachal Pradesh</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tourism.nagaland.gov.in/.\">Nagaland</a> and parts of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.andamans.gov.in/\">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>. Apply at least 3 months in advance. In India, apply at the liaison office of the state for which you need a permit or the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Permits for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands can be issued on arrival in Port Blair but this is not the case for the other states. Permit regulations can change at any time. Contact the relevant state liaison office or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://boi.gov.in/\">Indian Bureau of Immigration</a> for the latest guidance.</p>\n\n<p>For travelling to Mizoram, you need to register online with the Superintendent of Police in Aizawl or state CID at e-FRRO online portal. If you decide that it is essential to travel to Manipur, you will need to inform the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) office in Imphal Manipur of your arrival in the state by road or the Immigration counter at the Imphal airport if flying into the state.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling to Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland you are advised to check guidelines issued by local authorities \u2013 you should do the same if you decide that it is essential to travel to Manipur. This is because traffic along the National Highways connecting them with each other and with Assam may be disrupted due to blockades and protests, particularly in border areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"east-india\">East India</h2>\n\n<p>Maoist (or Naxalite) insurgents target police officers, paramilitary forces and government officials. This caused several deaths and injuries in 2019.

Most thefts from visitors take place around the main bus stations in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Avoid walking around quiet areas, especially after dark. Leave valuables and cash in a hotel safe, where practical. Keep copies of important documents in a separate place Report any thefts to the police as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities and/your tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious if over-friendly people approach you offering to act as guides or selling goods, or who claim to know you and ask for a lift. Don\u2019t accept food or drink from strangers; people have been robbed after eating drugged food.</p>\n\n<p>House burglaries, including by armed gangs, do occur though crime rates are low by regional standards. There has been an increase in break-ins in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Limbe, including violent assaults on residents. Review your security systems and watch out for anything unusual.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>Since March 2020 there have been reports of possible incidents of unrest and violence in rural areas of Mulanje, linked to rumours of bloodsuckers. This is further to similar incidents of violence and unrest reported during the period September to December 2017 and July 2018 in the areas of Mulanje, Thyolo, Chiradzulu, Phalombe and also in rural parts of Blantyre, Zomba and Nsanje districts. You should continue to exercise extreme caution if you\u2019re travelling in these areas, especially after dark, avoid any demonstrations or large groups of people and follow local security advice.</p>\n\n<p>Seek security advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mcm.org.mw\">Mulanje Mountain Club</a> if you intend to climb Mulanje mountain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Spontaneous demonstrations related to governance and economic issues can occur. If you\u2019re in Malawi, avoid large crowds or demonstrations, monitor this travel advice and local media for updates and keep any local and international travel plans under review.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h3>\n<p>You can drive in Malawi using a UK driving licence for up to 90 days or an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/driving-abroad/idp\">International Driving Permit</a> for up to one year. You should carry a valid driving licence, a copy of your passport and your visa or residence permit at all times when driving, as you may need to produce these at police check points.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent fuel shortages in Malawi. Do not take accessibility of fuel for travel in the country for granted, and plan ahead accordingly to ensure that you can reach your planned destination. Where fuel is available, there can often be long queues.</p>\n\n<p>Slow down in all built-up areas. Traffic police often place speed cameras where there are no signs showing the speed limit. The police can impose on the spot fines.</p>\n\n<p>Driving in Malawi can be hazardous. Always wear a seatbelt and avoid travel after dark. Potholes, animals, abandoned vehicles and cyclists can cause serious accidents, as can vehicles travelling at night without lights.</p>\n\n<p>Malawi has a very high rate of fatalities on the road. Travel between towns by public minibus or pick-up truck isn\u2019t recommended; vehicles are often in poor condition and overloaded. Emergency services are basic. Larger coach services do run between the major towns and are more reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Lock car doors and keep windows closed. Armed carjacking is a risk, especially for drivers of four-by-four vehicles. Don\u2019t offer lifts to strangers and look out for obstructions in the road ahead.</p>\n\n<p>When driving, be very wary if another car signals you to pull over or blocks your progress.  In recent years there have been a small number of kidnapping incidents involving foreign nationals (including a British national in 2021) taken from their vehicles in Malawi by criminals.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>The Malawi Police Service has introduced breathalyser tests, and regularly stops vehicles for speeding. There are speed cameras on the main roads. Drivers caught drink driving or speeding can have their licences and vehicles confiscated on the spot. Convicted drivers face a fine and/or imprisonment. The blood alcohol limit is 0.08g per 100ml of blood (the same as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).</p>\n",

Don\u2019t travel with anyone other than your tour operator. If you need to take a taxi from the airport, make sure it\u2019s a registered one and not a private vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Car-related crime and muggings occur from time to time, not only in Havana but also in Santiago de Cuba and other areas. Take care in central Havana at night. Use a taxi rather than walk, even if you\u2019re only a few blocks away from your destination. There have been attacks on foreigners in hire cars after their tyres have been deliberately punctured. If you get a puncture in a remote area, drive on to a town before stopping. Don\u2019t stop for hitch-hikers as they\u2019ve also been known to carry out attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of pickpockets and bag-snatchers, especially in Old Havana, on public transport, at major tourist sites and in nightclubs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash, avoid wearing expensive jewellery and leave valuables in the hotel safe. Carry a copy of your passport and lock the original away. Beware of thefts from rooms, particularly in private guest houses (\u201ccasas particulares\u201d). Hi-tech items like phones and laptops are highly sought after in Cuba and are particularly attractive to thieves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors can hire cars, but  fuel shortages across Cuba can lead to tourists having difficulty acquiring petrol and diesel,  including in  Havana. You should bear that in mind if planning to travel for longer distances and consider travelling with a registered tour operator instead.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Cuba using a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months from the date of your entry into the country. Foreign residents, both permanent and temporary, who stay in Cuba for more than 6 months will need to pass a Cuban Driving test in order to get a Cuban Licence. If you rent a car make sure the insurance includes local third party cover.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst valid foreign driving licences are generally accepted, it may be advisable to obtain an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP), as 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>All drivers and passengers of motorcycles and scooters are required by law to wear a crash helmet. In view of serious accidents that have involved tourists, you should not use mopeds or three wheel Coco-Taxis for travel around Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are variable. Many vehicles, including public transport, are badly maintained. Roads are poorly lit and sign-posted. Beware of cyclists, potholes and cars that stop without warning to pick up hitch-hikers. Vehicles that break down are often left on the road until repairs can be made. Avoid driving at night, when animals and unlit vehicles are a real danger.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t drink and drive.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident the police investigation may take several months to resolve. During this time, you will normally not be allowed to leave Cuba and may even be detained. If convicted of killing someone in a road traffic accident, you can expect to receive a very lengthy prison sentence. If you do have a serious accident, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-havana\">British Embassy</a> as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Official (yellow) taxis are generally reliable. Avoid private taxis and the older model of private cars being offered as taxis, which lack proper licensing and modern safety features.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are concerns about standards of maintenance of public transport. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CU\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Protests took place in Cuba in July 2021 and further protests are possible. You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of local authorities. During periods of tension, access to the internet may be blocked in some areas.</p>\n\n<p>Cuba is a one-party state. There is a high level of social control and a strong police presence. There are widespread restrictions on freedom of speech, association and assembly for Cuban nationals. Political demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government may be broken up.</p>\n\n",

The policy on importation of drones is under review and, for the time being, Cuban Customs advises visitors not to bring drones.

Cuban courts tend to hand out severe penalties for those convicted of drugs-related offences.

In the aftermath of a hurricane in Cuba, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. Even in holiday resorts, utility services can\u2019t be guaranteed. In the event of extreme weather conditions flights to and from Cuba may be delayed or cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>Tropical storm conditions are possible from Friday 17 November which could affect south eastern Cuba bringing heavy rainfall. You should closely monitor local and international weather updates from the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">US National Hurricane Center</a>\u00a0and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator including any evacuation orders. Spanish language alerts are available from the Cuban Defensa Civil (Civil Defense) organisation.</p>\n\n<p>See our\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">Tropical Cyclones</a>\u00a0page for advice on what to do if you are caught up in a storm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Cuba is located in an active earthquake zone.

Some casas particulares (guest houses/ bed &amp; breakfasts), and private bars and restaurants prefer cash payments in dollars or euros. It is advisable to exchange GBP for Euros or USD before you arrive in Cuba. Some hotels only accept bankcard payments. Check with your bank before you travel to confirm that your debit, credit and ATM cards will work in Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>It is currently illegal to exchange money other than at Cadeca exchange houses. Opening times and the availability of currency at Cadecas may vary. Ignore individuals offering exchange facilities to avoid queues. Cadeca exchange houses at airports buy Euros, GBP, USD and some other currencies in exchange for CUP. However, you cannot exchange your CUP back at airports.</p>\n\n<p>CUP is also obtainable at ATMs using a bankcard. Currency available at ATMs and Cadeca exchange houses may be limited, so it is a good idea to bring cash to cover your stay. Euros and USD are accepted more widely than Sterling. Bank notes should be in good condition with no tears, rips or markings. Scottish bank notes cannot be exchanged.</p>\n\n<p>You should not take CUP out of the country. At the end of your stay, you are advised to spend your CUP or exchange them to a foreign currency before reaching the airport on departure, as this service is not provided at the Cadeca money exchange counter there. Foreign currency in Euros, US or Canadian dollars can be used for cash payments in duty free shops or cafes in the departure area after passing immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your hotel or tour operator for the most up to date information before you travel.</p>\n",

These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>There is disruption to air travel to and from Bamako, and a risk of protests due to the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023. Check with your travel provider ahead of your travel. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a> pages.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country. The kidnap threat is most significant in northern and central Mali, and increasingly in the south. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks and kidnaps targeting Westerners in Bamako and across southern Mali. We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night and in places frequented by westerners. In July 2022, the AQ-affiliated Islamist terrorist group, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) made public statements setting out their intention to conduct attacks in Bamako. A series of recent attacks in central and southern Mali demonstrate a deteriorating security situation and heightened risk of attacks in the capital. In July 2022, terrorists targeted the Kati military camp, just 15km from the centre of Bamako.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, as these are likely to be targets. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship,  businesses with western interests and non-governmental organisations are also likely to be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods and during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods.</p>\n\n<p>At times when the risk is heightened, you should expect a robust security presence, particularly in Bamako. This can include police patrols, police security checks in restaurants and hotels and vehicle and personal security checks. Foreigners are not exempt. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is an ongoing risk. Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Bamako. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days\u2019 stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako). See Safety and Security.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited, especially outside Bamako. If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bamako\">British Embassy in Bamako</a>. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the\u00a0FCDO\u00a0being able to evacuate you in an emergency. If you need urgent help because something has happened to a friend or relative abroad, contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on 020 7008 5000 (24 hours).</p>\n\n",

The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako. If your travel is essential, we advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night.</p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is an ongoing risk. . Due to the withdrawal of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Mali. You should remain vigilant and monitor local media for any developments.</p>\n\n<p>Inter and intra-communal security incidents persist in many parts of the country, most notably in Mopti and Segou regions. In some instances, terrorist groups have become involved in these conflicts. In March 2019, 160 villagers were killed by masked gunmen in a single attack in Ogossagou in central Mali. Landmines are used by groups operating in Centre, North and North East Mali.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in Segou and Sikasso has sharply declined since 2020 with a string of notable attacks in Segou region and increasing levels of terrorist related activity in Sikasso region. Terrorists are known to operate out of national parks and forest areas. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>On 1 June 2022, gunmen targeted and killed three aid workers\u00a0in the Kayes region (bordering Senegal and Mauritania). There have been other known attacks on aid workers across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in Mali can be difficult and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>On 24 May 2021, a second military coup resulted in the arrests and resignation of the former transitional President Bah N\u2019Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta, former Vice President, has assumed control and appointed a government for the rest of the transition period.</p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is ongoing. Regular, large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako, resulting in burning of tyres, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have previously been reports of several deaths and injuries. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and may see a heavy police and security presence. Protests have taken place recently in Bamako. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should leave the area immediately, remain vigilant, and follow the local news as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. You should stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations. Maintain several days\u2019 stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Night-time checkpoints operate in Bamako at various locations. Checkpoints are in place from approximately 9pm until dawn.</p>\n\n<p>The use of taxi services in Bamako is not recommended due to low standards of vehicle maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Keep vehicle and personal identification documents with you at all times while travelling by road. Approach security checkpoints slowly and comply with instructions given. There have been incidents late at night where people dressed as policemen have demanded money from drivers in Bamako. Ask to see identification. Don\u2019t resist if the person is armed.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions off the main roads are often poor, especially in the rainy season (June to October). Other road users may drive dangerously. You should take particular care and attention when driving in urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a vehicle accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report immediately. If you remain on the spot you may be vulnerable. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

In July 2022 JNIM made public statements setting out their intention to conduct attacks in Bamako. A series of recent attacks in central and southern Mali, including at the Kati military camp just 15km from the centre of Bamako, demonstrate a deteriorating security situation and heightened risk of attacks in the capital.  We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night and in places frequented by westerners.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, as these are likely to be targets. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship, businesses with western interests and non-governmental organisations are also likely to be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>During public holidays and festivals, including New Year and Eid celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>Large gatherings can also include music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. The Festival au D\u00e9sert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 and has not taken place since due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country are also vulnerable to attack. There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are known to operate out of national parks and forest areas.</p>\n\n<p>Notable attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 22 July 2022, there was an attack on the Kati military base, 15km from Bamako city centre, killing one soldier. Seven attackers were also killed.</li>\n  <li>On 21 July 2022, there were six attacks across central and southern Mali targeting Malian armed forces targets, including Kolokani, Kono, Douentza, Bapho, Segou and S\u00e9var\u00e9.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 16 July 2022, terrorists attacked a security post at Zantiguila, approximately 70km from Bamako on the road to Segou, killing six.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>On 18 June 2022, terrorists attacked the villages of Diallassagou, Dianweli and Deguessagou, killing at least 132 civilians.</li>\n  <li>On 22 January 2022, terrorists attacked the BARKHANE camp in Gao, resulting in the death of one French soldier.</li>\n  <li>On 2 April 2021, terrorists attacked the MINUSMA camp in Aguelhok, which resulted in the death of four peacekeepers.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 15 March 2021, terrorists attacks a Malian Army security post in Tessit, killing 33 soldiers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>On 14 June 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military convey approximately 160km north of Segou town, killing 24 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 6 April 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military base in Bamba, Gao region, killing 25 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 26 January 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military camp in Sokolo, Segou region, killing 20 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 24 February 2019, insurgents attacked the Koulikoro Training Centre, the main training base in Mali for the European Union Training Mission, approximately 55km northeast of Bamako. Four Malian military personnel were injured.</li>\n  <li>In June 2017, terrorists attacked Le Campement resort in Kangaba, on the outskirts of Bamako, which resulted in a number of deaths.</li>\n  <li>In March 2016, gunmen attacked the headquarters of the European Union Training Mission in the centre of Bamako.</li>\n  <li>In November 2015, terrorists attacked the Radisson Hotel in Bamako, killing a number of hostages including foreign nationals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Following French/African military intervention in Mali in January 2013, there is a high threat of retaliatory kidnap or attack against western interests. There have been a number of bomb attacks in Gao, Kidal, Timbuktu and in Khalil in recent years. Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, vehicle ambushes, small arms fire and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Malian, MINUSMA (the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali) and international security forces are regularly targeted, particularly in the regions of Kidal, Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Menaka, and attacks are frequent.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of terrorism is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. The threat to western interests in the region remains.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP). These groups operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. There is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country. The kidnap threat is most significant in northern and central Mali, and increasingly in the south. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks and kidnaps targeting Westerners in Bamako and across southern Mali. We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night, and to vary your daily routine. Avoid walking around the city alone after dark.  Westerners have been kidnapped in Mali, including in Kidal, Kayes, Timbuktu, Gao and Hombori, and the wider Sahel region.</p>\n\n<p>Recent kidnap incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In May 2022, three Italian nationals and a Togolese national were kidnapped by armed men in Sincina, near the southern border with Burkina Faso</li>\n  <li>A French national was kidnapped from Gao in April 2021</li>\n  <li>Four hostages, including French and Italian nationals, were released in October 2020.</li>\n  <li>An Italian and Canadian national were kidnapped in December 2018 in Burkina Faso and were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in northeast Mali after reportedly escaping.</li>\n  <li>In May 2019, two French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped in northern Benin by an armed group. The guide was found dead and the hostages were later rescued in northern Burkina Faso whilst reportedly on their way to Mali</li>\n  <li>In January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in northern Burkina Faso and subsequently found dead.</li>\n  <li>Several foreign nationals were kidnapped in from the northeastern region of neighbouring Burkina Faso in September 2018.</li>\n  <li>In February 2017 a Colombian nun was kidnapped in Sikasso region, in the south of Mali, and has since been released in October 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are working or travelling in Mali, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, and shopping areas, and places frequented by westerners like hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should vary your daily routine and avoid walking around the city alone after dark.  You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-terrorist-threat-in-the-sahel\">The terrorist threat in the Sahel</h3>\n\n<p>There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include JNIM, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Sahel Province  (ISSP), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine, Katiba Macina and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for JNIM. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n",

For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-facilities\">Medical facilities</h2>\n<p>Medical facilities in Mali are very limited. Private hospitals include Golden Life American Hospital (Badalabougou, rue 50 porte 734; telephone: (+223) 20 22 11 11; (+223) 20 22 99 99; contactglahospital.com), Polyclinique Internationale Bamako (Polyclinic Guindo) (Badalabougou Est rue 18 porte 19; telephone: (+223) 20 22 22 07; <a href=\"mailto:clinique@pib-mali.com\">clinique@pib-mali.com</a>) and Polyclinique Pasteur (Hamdallaye ACI 2000, Bamako BPE 4794; telephone: +223 20 29 10 10).</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Cholera, malaria and other tropical diseases are common to Mali. Outbreaks of meningitis also occur, usually from the end of February to mid-April.</p>\n\n<p>You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel - as is the case for all of Mali. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the FCDO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel.

If you have the wrong visa or if you overstay your visa, you could be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en\">Turkmenistan Embassy in London</a> at least a month ahead of your intended travel date.</p>\n\n<p>You need a letter of invitation to support your application. For tourist visits, authorised travel agents can provide these letters.      If you are travelling on business  , you need letters from relevant government ministries or companies you want to do business with. If you want to attend an exhibition or event, the organiser normally provides visa support.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep your letter of invitation with you when you are in Turkmenistan  .</p>\n\n<p>The Turkmenistan Embassy will refer your visa application to Ashgabat for a decision, which can take up to a month. There is an accelerated 24-hour service costing about 150 US dollars.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transit-visas-and-travelling-through-turkmenistan-by-car\">Transit visas and travelling through Turkmenistan by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can use a transit visa if you will be in Turkmenistan for less than 5 days. You cannot change your transit visa to a tourist visa, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to change your route. Border officials may close Turkmen border crossings without notice.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy a transit visa at Baku seaport. If you want to travel to Azerbaijan by sea, you need to have visas for both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be charged up to 150 US dollars to bring a car into Turkmenistan by land or sea.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/228/turkmenistan\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Turkmenistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying for more than 3 days, you must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within 3 days of your arrival.</p>\n\n<p>In Ashgabat, register at the office at 57 Azadi Street. If you\u2019re not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department office. Ask your hotel manager or employer as they will need to confirm your departure date in writing. In most cases they will register your stay on your behalf. You must provide 2 passport-size photos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tourism-tax\">Tourism tax</h3>\n\n<p>On arrival, you must pay a migration fee of 14 US dollars. All foreign visitors except diplomats are also charged a \u2018tourism tax\u2019 of 2 US dollars for each day of their stay in Turkmenistan. Hotels include the tax as a separate item on your bill.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.gov.tm/en/customs-info/for-individuals\">goods you can take into or out of Turkmenistan</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Tobacco products to the amount of 2 packs\u2019 means you can bring one of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 packets of cigarettes \u2013 a total of 40 cigarettes</li>\n  <li>2 cigars</li>\n  <li>2 packs of tobacco each weighing no more than a packet of cigarettes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is illegal to give tobacco products as a gift. If you are caught, you could be fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-turkmenistan\">Taking money into Turkmenistan</h3>\n\n<p>Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based society. Carry cash and pay in the national currency, manat. Some larger hotels accept US dollars, but other outlets are only allowed to accept manat. There are harsh penalties for them if they take your payment in other currencies.</p>\n\n<p>You can exchange cash US dollars and euros for manat easily at a bank or money exchange. Bring new, clean notes as exchanges will reject damaged or marked notes. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. Manat cannot be re-converted, so exchange only as much as you need.</p>\n\n<p>There are a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat, but they can run out of manat notes. There\u2019s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction.</p>\n\n",

Ramadan in Turkmenistan in 2024 will likely begin in mid-March    and will last for 30 days. Get more advice from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.

The Turkmen can be sensitive about having their picture taken without their consent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"internet-and-mobile-network\">Internet and mobile network</h3>\n\n<p>Internet connections outside the larger hotels can be unreliable. Many social media apps and websites, including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp are blocked. Access to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail is often difficult. VPNs are illegal in Turkmenistan and are usually blocked as soon as the authorities identify them.</p>\n\n<p>There is a single state-owned mobile telephone provider, Altyn Asyr, which uses the TM CELL brand. Altyn Asyr does not provide a roaming service and the quality of the network is low.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-turkmens\">Relationships with Turkmens</h3>\n\n<p>The Turkmen authorities sometimes prosecute Turkmen women if they start a sexual relationship with a foreign man. They could give the foreign man a fine and deport him.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Male same-sex activity is illegal, punishable by a prison sentence.

Road travel at night outside cities is particularly dangerous because of the condition of the roads. There is a 60km/h speed limit in much of Ashgabat, enforced by both static speed cameras and police with mobile speed cameras. There are no signs warning of speed cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Licensed taxis are clearly identified and are white or yellow. Avoid unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Although taxis have meters, drivers will usually ask foreign nationals for a fee of around 20 manat. They might also ask for payment in US dollars, but this is illegal.

For more information, contact insurance companies in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Petrol stations are limited in rural areas and diesel is often unavailable. Make sure you take all you need for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If the police stop you and issue a fine, they should give you a paper copy with instructions on how to pay. You can pay fines through a payment terminal\u00a0or in a bank. Do not pay cash directly to the police officers, although some may have a payment terminal you can use. Some fines may be reduced if you pay quickly. Payment terminals are available on streets and other places such as malls, grocery stores, kiosks and restaurants.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-safety\">Driving safety</h3>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly lit and maintained with road works or damaged roads often not clearly signposted. There is currently no MOT and no legal requirement for vehicles to be insured. Pedestrians often have a low awareness of road safety. Roads outside of Bishkek are often blocked by snow in winter.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving, particularly over long distances and avoid giving lifts to hitchhikers. Drivers have been robbed by people they picked up.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever possible use main roads when travelling in and around Bishkek.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Kyrgyzstan. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a 17,500 Kyrgyz som fine and have your licence revoked for 1 year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-buses\">Taxis and buses</h3>\n\n<p>You should avoid flagging down taxis. Use telephone, text messaging, or taxi services, which are more reputable and have English-speaking dispatchers.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using local buses and minibuses if possible. They are not always maintained properly and pickpockets operate on them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>In May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes buying flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Kyrgyzstan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u202fDepartment for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of earthquakes and tremors are frequent. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures and follow advice from local authorities. The\u00a0US Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0has information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avalanches-and-landslides\">Avalanches and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>In the mountains, avalanches and landslides often block roads, particularly in the spring.</p>\n\n",

Speed limits (30 <abbr title=\"Miles per hour\">MPH</abbr> max) are signed across the island but drivers are unlikely to travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles an hour or above third gear.  Vehicles travelling downhill must give way to those travelling uphill. Driving is on the left. Drink drive laws are strictly applied with a limit of 50 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. Public transport on St Helena is very limited but hire cars are available.</p>\n\n<p>UK driving licences are valid on St Helena for three months after which a local (St Helena) licence must be obtained. Licences can be purchased from the Post Office in Jamestown and are valid for one year.</p>\n\n<p>There is a public minibus service with a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bus-Timetable-2022-FINAL.pdf\">timetable</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ascension\">Ascension</h3>\n\n<p>There is a public minibus service which operates on Friday and Saturday nights only.  There is no other public transport on Ascension Island, but bus tours with a driver can be arranged. There are a small number of hire cars.</p>\n\n<p>The speed limit is 20mph in Georgetown and Two Boats Village, and when passing the US Base. It\u2019s either 30mph or 40 mph elsewhere. If you\u2019re expecting to stay for more than 3 months, you must apply for an Ascension Island Driving Licence from the Post Office.</p>\n\n<p>Feral sheep, donkeys and land crabs (protected species) can gather on the roads, especially during wet weather.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of sites which are out of bounds. On arrival to Ascension visitors are briefed where they\u2019re permitted to visit but if you\u2019re unsure it\u2019s always worth checking with either the police station, harbour authorities or Ascension Island Government personnel first.</p>\n\n<p>The waters around Ascension can be dangerous with strong undercurrents and large swells. You should exercise extreme caution if you enter the sea. You are strongly advised to seek local advice and heed warning signs displayed at the beaches before considering swimming, diving or snorkelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tristan-da-cunha\">Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors are not allowed to hike up the Base or to Marys Peak unless accompanied by a Tristan guide. Trips to areas away from the main settlement on Tristan, including to Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands, must be made with a guide for safety reasons. A fee is payable and an indemnity declaration must be signed. Let others know where you are going and when you intend to return.</p>\n\n<p>You need prior approval from the Administrator to visit Gough Island, which is 200 miles away by sea to the south. Permission to land will rarely be granted as Gough is a World Heritage Site.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-to-st-helena-ascension-and-tristan-da-cunha\">Getting to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"st-helena-1\">St Helena</h3>\n\n<p>St Helena has weekly return flights from Johannesburg provided by Airlink.

To enquire about booking a flight contact: <a href=\"mailto:flight.bookings@ascension.gov.ac\">flight.bookings@ascension.gov.ac</a></p>\n\n<p>There is limited accommodation available to visitors on Ascension Island.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tristan-da-cunha-1\">Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<p>Travel to the Island is by sea only. Fishing/supply vessels from Cape Town visit the Island eight times a year, and there is one annual visit made by a South African research vessel in September/October. Access to berths is very limited and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tristandc.com/shipping.php\">bookings are prioritised</a>. Due to the limited harbour facilities, vessels have to anchor offshore and passengers are ferried by smaller local boats. This can be hazardous in bad weather. Approaching bad weather can mean that you have to return to your ship ahead of schedule. Fishing requirements may mean that ships need to depart Tristan ahead of or behind schedule. Connecting airline bookings in South Africa should be flexible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-assistance\">Emergency assistance</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"st-helena-2\">St Helena</h3>\n\n<p>If you need emergency assistance, contact the local police (telephone 22626 or 999).

If you\u2019re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://kemlu.go.id/london/en\">Indonesia\u2019s embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"death-from-covid-19-in-indonesia\">Death from COVID-19 in Indonesia</h2>\n\n<p>If COVID-19 is given as cause of death and you would like to arrange a local cremation and repatriation of ashes, you will need to make contact with a local undertaker within 4 hours of the death registration to give your instructions. If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.</p>\n\n<p>You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider or the nearest Indonesian Embassy or Consulate to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Indonesian law does not allow dual nationality for those aged 18 and older. If you are a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you could have difficulties with immigration in Indonesia. You might have to renounce your nationality or hand in your Indonesian passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"e-visas\">E-visas</h3>\n\n<p>You can apply for an e-visa before arrival on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://molina.imigrasi.go.id/\">Indonesian immigration website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas-on-arrival\">Visas on arrival</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals who visit Indonesia for the following reasons can also apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of 500,000 Indonesian rupiah:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tourism</li>\n  <li>official visit or government duties</li>\n  <li>business or official meeting</li>\n  <li>procurement of goods</li>\n  <li>transit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The visa is valid for 30 days. It can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application to an immigration office within Indonesia. Make sure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine of 1 million rupiah a day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kitas-extension-stay-or-work-permit\">KITAS extension (stay or work permit)</h3>\n\n<p>KITAS holders with expiring stay permit but currently outside Indonesia can apply for an extension through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of the passport and proof of leaving Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report the foreigner\u2019s arrival within 30 days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visa-scams\">Visa scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of visa scams by fake visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong visa. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of 1 million Indonesia rupiah per day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. Use the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://molina.imigrasi.go.id/\">Indonesian Immigration self-service portal.</a></p>\n\n<p>Visa scams are increasing in Indonesia. Some travellers have lost significant amounts of money. Others have been deported despite paying large fees to an agent to get the correct visa or extension.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to use to use an agent check they are reputable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"overstaying-your-visa\">Overstaying your visa</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors who overstay without the proper permissions can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of 1 million Indonesian rupiah per day is paid.</p>\n\n<p>If you have overstayed your visa for less than 60 days, you must pay your fine at the airport. After 60 days, you will be detained until the fine is paid.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"proof-of-onward-travel\">Proof of onward travel</h3>\n\n<p>Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (such as a return or onward air ticket). Make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"airport-tax\">Airport tax</h2>\n\n<p>Airport tax is included in the cost of all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax might not be included in the price of the ticket. Check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/106/indonesia\">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your circumstances, these may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>polio</li>\n  <li>yellow fever</li>\n  <li>Zika virus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering\">Registering</h3>\n\n<p>If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police at the nearest police station.

Western interests are also at risk. Small-scale attacks occur on a regular basis and further incidents are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. Potential targets include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>beach resorts</li>\n  <li>bars and restaurants</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>markets</li>\n  <li>shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets</li>\n  <li>tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>places of worship</li>\n  <li>foreign embassies</li>\n  <li>polling stations</li>\n  <li>ferry terminals and airports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk during holiday periods such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Christmas, New Year and Easter</li>\n  <li>Chinese New Year</li>\n  <li>Nyepi (Balinese New Year)</li>\n  <li>Islamic celebrations and holidays such as Ramadan</li>\n  <li>local elections</li>\n  <li>presidential inaugurations</li>\n  <li>Independence Day (17 August)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of the local authorities, remain particularly vigilant and maintain a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, a suicide bomber attacked a Police post on Jalan Astana Anyar, in Bandung, West Java, killing one and injuring 8 people</li>\n  <li>in 2021, there was a suicide attack outside the Catholic Cathedral Church at JaIan Kajaolalido, Makassar</li>\n  <li>in 2020, a police officer was killed and another injured during an attack on a police station in Kalimantan</li>\n  <li>in 2019, a suicide bomber attacked police headquarters in Medan, Sumatra, injuring 4 police officers and 2 civilians</li>\n  <li>in 2018, there was an explosion at a police headquarters, and at 3 churches, in Surabaya, East Java, causing multiple deaths and injuries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation in Indonesia is stable. However, internal developments such as elections, presidential inaugurations and external developments, including in the Middle East, can trigger protests or unrest. Nationwide student protests took place in 2019 and 2020, and could reoccur at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all protests, demonstrations and student and political rallies as they could become violent without notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Reported cases of rape and sexual assault are high in Bali and Lombok. Exercise the same caution you would in the UK when travelling at night and avoid areas that are poorly lit.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to travel by taxi, use only registered companies (such as Bluebird, Silverbird or Express) and ensure the driver\u2019s identity is shown. If you are booking with a mobile app, check the driver is the same as the person on the app and share your journey with a friend using the app. Be wary of drivers claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps trying to pick up passengers off the street.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risk of street crime and pickpocketing, particularly in busy tourist areas in Bali, where there have been reports of bag-snatching. Concealing your bag as much as possible will help avoid bag-snatching and only carry essential items. Take care of your passport and bank cards.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of thieves on public transport. If you\u2019re travelling by car keep doors locked at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Credit card fraud is common. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. Criminals sometimes place a fake telephone number on ATMs advising customers to report problems.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licensed currency exchangers. Licensed currency exchangers can be identified by the presence of a sign titled \u2018Authorized Money Changer\u2019 and the formal name of the business, accompanied by logos and certificates issued by the Bank of Indonesia. On the logos and branding, there should be a QR Code that when opened shows the information of the business and proof of licenses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands. Make sure drinks are prepared in front of you and do not accept drinks from strangers at clubs and parties or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-strength-and-drugs\">Alcohol strength and drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars can be stronger than those in the UK and the measures of spirits are larger. In some cases, over drinking and taking drugs has resulted in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents and some British nationals have suffered psychiatric problems caused by alcohol, drugs and a lack of sleep. Drink responsibly and be aware of your limits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-poisoning-methanol\">Drink poisoning (methanol)</h3>\n\n<p>People, including British nationals, have died or suffered serious illness in Indonesia after drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol.</p>\n\n<p>Drink poisoning incidents have happened in bars, shops and hotels in tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. Criminal gangs make counterfeit replicas of well-known alcohol brands containing high amounts of methanol.</p>\n\n<p>Take extreme care when buying spirit-based drinks. Bottles may appear to be genuine when they\u2019re not, and bottle labels may not be accurate. Contaminated drinks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local spirits, including arak/arrack (a local rice or palm liquor)</li>\n  <li>spirit-based drinks, such as cocktails</li>\n  <li>brand name alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Symptoms of methanol poisoning can be similar to those of alcohol poisoning. The fact sheet on TravelHealthPro has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/25/personal-safety\">list of symptoms for methanol poisoning</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from drink poisoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>buy or drink alcoholic beverages at reputable licensed premises</li>\n  <li>be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits</li>\n  <li>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks</li>\n  <li>check bottle seals are intact</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/indonesia-list-of-medical-facilities-and-funeral-directors/list-of-medical-facilities-in-indonesia\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with show signs of alcohol-induced methanol poisoning or drink-spiking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-holidays\">Religious holidays</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Indonesia will take place on 10 March to 9 April 2024. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"balinese-new-year\">Balinese New Year</h3>\n\n<p>During Balinese New Year, known as Nyepi, local custom requires that all people in Bali observe a day of silence by staying indoors, turning off lights, and making no noise. Ngurah Rai International Airport is closed for the entire day. However, emergency services and hospitals are allowed to operate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must be able to show your valid travel document (passport) or stay permit (such as KITAS or KITAP) at any time when needed to do so by an active immigration officer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh consumption, production and distribution of alcohol are all illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process is public caning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with illegal drugs. Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process. British nationals have been caught and jailed for drug offences in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Police often raid venues (particularly in Bali) known to be frequented by foreigners. You may have to take a urine or blood test if there is a reasonable suspicion that drugs have been used. Criminal gangs in the UK and elsewhere are known to coerce people into carrying drugs across borders. Do not allow yourself to be persuaded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The province of Aceh enforces Sharia law. It is the only province in Indonesia to do so and the laws apply to both Muslims and non-Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual activity is illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process includes public caning, prison sentence or a fine which should be paid in gold.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a license. Indonesia is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes bans on trade in ivory and tiger parts. If you\u2019re caught purchasing or trafficking illegal goods you\u2019ll be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence and fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gambling\">Gambling</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh gambling is illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process includes public caning, prison sentence or a fine which should be paid in gold.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"extra-marital-sex\">Extra-marital sex</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh, extra-marital sex is illegal under Sharia law and punishable by public caning after a Sharia court process.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You cannot drive in Indonesia using a UK driving licence. You can drive using an International Driving Permit issued in Indonesia. International Driving Permits issued in the UK may need to be endorsed by the Indonesian licensing office in Jakarta.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving, riding or hiring any type of vehicle, ensure that you have the appropriate licence to do so. Check you are covered with your travel insurance company.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic discipline is very poor and there are several moped and motorbike accidents, including serious injury and fatalities in Bali. Make sure you wear a helmet if you\u2019re riding a motorbike or moped.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners involved in even minor traffic violations or accidents may be vulnerable to exploitation. Consider employing a private driver or hiring a car with a driver. Some multinational companies do not allow their expatriate staff to drive in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident or breakdown, make sure someone remains with your vehicle. If you have any concerns for your security, move to another location safely. Make yourself available for questioning by the police if requested to do so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by boat or ferry can be dangerous as the sea conditions can change rapidly. Vessels can be crowded, overloaded, poorly maintained and safety standards vary between providers.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re satisfied with safety standards before travelling, including availability of safety equipment such as life-jackets. Life-jackets suitable for children aren\u2019t always available so you may need to bring your own. Avoid travelling after dark unless you\u2019re satisfied the vessel is suitably equipped.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks against ships in and around the waters of Indonesia. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>There are lots of active volcanoes in Indonesia. They can erupt without warning. Villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius will usually be evacuated. Eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>There are 4 volcano alert levels:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>normal</li>\n  <li>advisory</li>\n  <li>watch</li>\n  <li>warning</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. Take extra care and follow the advice of the local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See the Multiplatform Application for Geohazard Mitigation and Assessment (MAGMA) in Indonesia for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://magma.esdm.go.id/v1/gunung-api/laporan\">updates on volcanic activity</a> (in Bahasa language).</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes areas beyond local exclusion zones have been affected by mud and debris flows (particularly in valleys) and volcanic ash falls. While near any volcano, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>exercise caution</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ash clouds can affect flight schedules and the operation of regional airports. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A fitted face mask may provide some protection. While masks should be available in Indonesia, you may choose to buy your own before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, be aware that you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Make sure you travel with sufficient supplies of any regular medicines to cater for this.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a major eruption, they may be increased levels of particulate and gaseous pollutants in the air, even in areas outside of the exclusion zones. Face masks only offer protection against small particulate matter; they do not protect against hazardous gases emitted by a volcano. Unless you\u2019re advised to evacuate, the best way to reduce your exposure is to remain inside and close all doors and windows.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mount-agung-bali\">Mount Agung, Bali</h3>\n\n<p>In 2018, Mount Agung in East Bali erupted, emitting gas and ash which resulted in the closure of Bali\u2019s airport and a number of nearby regional airports for a period of time. Climbers are recommended to limit activity around the crater. The alert level is subject to change at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers to Bali may find <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mount-agung-eruption-information-for-british-visitors-to-bali\">information on travel during the volcanic activity</a> useful.</p>\n\n<p>Further disruption cannot be ruled out. The local authorities have indicated that Mount Agung continues to show signs of volcanic activity and the possibility of volcanic eruptions remains.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mount-semeru-east-java\">Mount Semeru, East Java</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO\u00a0advises against all travel to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 5 km of the crater of Mount Semeru in Lumajang Regency, East Java</li>\n  <li>the southeast area of Mount Semeru along the Besuk Kobokan river, approximately 13km from the crater, and 500m from any Besuk Kobokan riverbank</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are exclusion zones put into place by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Mount Semeru erupted in 2022, emitting a 1,500 meters (4,921 ft) high ash cloud. Indonesian authorities have set an alert status of level 4 (of 4) and are warning of the potential for pyroclastic flows and lava flows along rivers, tributaries and valleys around Mount Semeru, especially along Besuk Kobokan, Besuk Bang, Besuk Kembar and Besuk Sat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mount-sinabung-north-sumatra\">Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO\u00a0advises against all travel to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 5km of the crater of Mount Sinabung in Karo Regency, North Sumatra</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is an exclusion zone put into place by the local authorities. Mount Sinabung erupted in 2021, sending a large column of smoke and ash into the sky.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>The Indonesian rainy season runs from September to January but can run into February. Monitor international and local weather reports if travelling during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Large areas of the country have been badly affected by heavy rains, landslides and flooding, including parts of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>West Sumatra</li>\n  <li>Central, East and West Java</li>\n  <li>Jakarta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flash floods and widespread flooding can occur across Indonesia. Cities, especially Jakarta, can suffer severe localised flooding which can result in major traffic congestion and power outages. The main toll road to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and other major roads in Jakarta can be affected by flooding. Slips and landslides occur in mountainous and remote areas, but also in urban areas.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving and walking. Keep a stock of bottled water and make sure your phone is charged.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes-and-tsunamis\">Earthquakes and tsunamis</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes happen regularly. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p>If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rtsp.bmkg.go.id/publicbull.php\">Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning Centre</a> issues warnings when a potential tsunami with significant impact is imminent or expected.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires continue to burn in Indonesia\u2019s forest and peatlands, mostly on Sumatra and Borneo, generating widespread haze that can affect air quality.</p>\n",

Although violence against foreigners is rare, a British national was abducted in  2013 and there were 3 separate incidents in 2009 targeting foreigners. There have been reports of Sharia (religious) police harassing foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the risk of politically motivated violence. Take particular care in remote areas.

Be alert to the risk of politically motivated violence.</p>\n\n<p>There is conflict between the Indonesian security forces and terrorists, including attacks upon police and civilians in 2021. This conflict is predominantly in the Sigi, Parigi Moutong and Poso regions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maluku-province\">Maluku Province</h2>\n\n<p>Maluku Province has experienced unrest and violence between different religious and tribal groups. Take particular care in Ambon, including Haruku Island (Pulau Haruku).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"papua\">Papua</h2>\n\n<p>Armed Papuan separatist groups are fighting for independence from Indonesia in the region of Papua. Violence has been steadily increasing since 2018. The Indonesian government has a heavy security presence throughout the region especially in Highland Papua, Central Papua provinces and along the border with Papua New Guinea. There are regular armed clashes between Papuan separatist groups (known as the TPNPB-OPM) and government security forces, mainly in the regions of Highland Papua and Central Papua.</p>\n\n<p>Clashes have resulted in civilian deaths, including foreign nationals. In  2020, a New Zealand national was shot dead and a number of Indonesian nationals were wounded in a mining facility in Highland Papua province.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2023:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a New Zealand national was kidnapped by a separatist group in Nduga, Highland Papua Province</li>\n  <li>the TPNPB-OPM issued a statement that foreigners in the Papua region would be targeted</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been several instances of Papuan separatists attacking commercial aircraft servicing remote communities via small local airfields, especially in Highland Papua and Central Papua provinces. This includes aircraft which are regularly used by foreign nationals and those working in the region as the only viable means of transportation.</p>\n\n<p>Political tensions have also led to violent demonstrations in cities across Papua, which have turned violent at short notice. Take local advice to help you avoid possible demonstrations and political rallies. Internet communications might be switched off in areas where demonstrations are planned. Make plans in advance in case you are affected.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel in the Highland Papua and Central Papua provinces be aware that the security situation is unpredictable and can change quickly, Take local advice to understand the current tensions, and how you can reduce your personal risks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the Indonesian government passed new legislation to reform the governance and administration of the Papua region. The existing provinces of Papua and West Papua have been reorganised into 6 provinces, which are now known as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Papua</li>\n  <li>West Papua</li>\n  <li>Central Papua</li>\n  <li>Highland Papua</li>\n  <li>South Papua</li>\n  <li>Southwest Papua</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have travelled to the area previously make sure you check the updated map.</p>\n\n<p>The UK Government has no permanent presence in the region. Consular services are delivered remotely from Jakarta. There are limited hospital facilities in the region. If you need emergency medical treatment, you are likely to be medically evacuated to Darwin in Australia.</p>\n",

Make sure you have enough cash in euros to pay for insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>The standard of roads varies from fair to poor.

The quality of fuel varies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes delays at the border crossings between Kosovo and North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania, and Kosovo and Serbia.

Taxis are readily available in Pristina. Registered taxi firms are the safest option and fares are regulated \u2013 these usually need to be ordered via phone, although some are introducing apps. Operators usually speak a reasonable level of English. Taxis that approach you for a fare are often unofficial and can overcharge. International ride-hailing apps are not available.

There were robberies and attacks at, and around, Cote D\u2019Or beach on the island of Praslin in late 2017. Police responded with increased foot patrols and lighting.

Airlines or final destinations, however, may require it, and you should check the requirements if necessary.  Visitors who develop symptoms of a possible respiratory infection will be referred to health services for further assessment and testing. You can expect to be contacted by the authorities in Seychelles if you test positive for COVID-19.  If you display severe symptoms, particularly if you are in an at-risk category, then you may be cared for at a government-run facility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Symptomatic Cases</strong></p>\n\n<p>All visitors arriving in Seychelles are advised to report any symptoms they develop, that may be associated with COVID-19 to their nearest health centre. They may be subject to testing, isolation, care and/or quarantine, as per national protocols in-effect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asymptomatic Cases</strong></p>\n\n<p>People who are asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic must undergo self-isolation at their accommodation establishment at their own cost.

Guests may not change accommodation during a period of self-isolation without the permission of the Public Health Authority.</p>\n\n<p>If parents are required to self-isolate, then minors will be expected to stay with them or with other family members.

                        "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Most visits to Seychelles are trouble free. However, there have been instances of break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists. Crime is generally non-violent, but bags have been snatched, cars broken into and tourists robbed while walking at night. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions.</p>\n\n<p>Parked cars, residential accommodation including guest houses and hotels, beaches, and marked and unmarked walking trails may be targeted. Do not take valuables, and walk with organised groups.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain at least the same level of security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your living accommodation is secure. Use a hotel safe to store valuables, money and passports. Do not leave valuables in cars or anywhere on display, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing eye-catching jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation, particularly in isolated areas, should have adequate security, including external security lighting, grilles and overnight security guards.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and when outside hotel grounds, carry a mobile phone with roaming capability for use in an emergency. It\u2019s worth checking roaming rates with your mobile phone service provider as they can be extremely high.</p>\n\n<p>Take care in isolated areas and also in more popular places like Beau Vallon and the back streets of Victoria, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Call the Seychelles Police on +438 428 8000 to report any incident.</p>\n\n<p>For any emergencies, please call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Mah\u00e9 is mountainous, and roads are narrow and winding, often with sheer drops and hairpin bends. Not all such roads are equipped with safety barriers. Deep, uncovered storm drains flank many roads. Take care when driving. Drink-driving is a problem, so be aware of other road users who may behave erratically. Sudden heavy downpours can reduce visibility and road surface conditions quickly. Potholes can appear in the road suddenly after heavy rains - drivers sometimes veer sharply across lanes to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>When returning hired vehicles, obtain an acknowledgement that the vehicle has not been damaged during the period of hire. Third party insurance is compulsory, and comprehensive insurance is also available locally. UK driving licences are valid for stays of up to three months.</p>\n\n<p>Buses are cheap but infrequent on some routes (a timetable is available from the bus station in Victoria or on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sptc.sc/timetable/\">Seychelles Public Transport Corporation website</a>). Most public bus routes do not operate after 8pm.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are generally of a good standard. Taxi meters are increasingly common but if a taxi is not equipped with one, you should agree a fare before starting your journey.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Piracy within the region has decreased but some risk remains. Stay away from  areas of conflict and seek advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukmto.org\">United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org\">Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the inner island resorts are accessible by ferry. You should pay attention to safety briefings when taking any boat trips and make sure life jackets are provided, especially on smaller excursion boats.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming or snorkelling, even on organised excursions, and particularly with children or the elderly; drowning does occur.</p>\n\n<p>Seychelles experiences 2 seasonal changes during the year. The start and end of the seasons are less predictable than in previous years, but generally the northwest monsoon season runs from December to March and the southeast trade winds make for a drier and slightly cooler season from May to September. Currents and waves are affected by this.</p>\n\n<p>Beaches which are safer at certain times of the year can be dangerous for swimming at other times. In general, the west coast is affected during the northwest monsoon and the east coast is affected during the southeast winds. Beaches at the southern tip are not recommended for swimming at any time. You should exercise caution when swimming, especially with children. Currents can be strong and drownings occur. Seek local advice about the conditions before you visit the beaches in Seychelles. Heed signage on beaches and stay within your depth.</p>\n\n<p>Dangerous rip currents can occur off the popular Beau Vallon beach (and some other beaches) when the sea is rough.</p>\n\n<p>Beaches do not always show safety information and you shouldn\u2019t assume they\u2019re safe. Lifeguards are not numerous, though some are stationed on popular beaches. Ask hotel staff about conditions and safety on nearby beaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking\">Hiking</h2>\n\n<p>It is generally safe to hike in Seychelles; however, there have been instances of visitors getting lost while on nature walks or hiking on trails. It is therefore important for you to plan well and follow appropriate safety measures when hiking. For advice and safety tips, please see guidance from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.spga.gov.sc/\">Seychelles Parks and Gardens Authority</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>The Presidential election in October 2020 resulted in the first change of government in Seychelles for 43 years.  The first democratic transition of power followed, with a peaceful handover from the United Seychelles Party, led by Danny Faure, to Linyon Demokratik Seselwa, led by the new President, Wavel Ramkalawan.</p>\n",

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<p>There is a reasonably well equipped hospital in the capital, Thimphu, with modern diagnostic facilities such as ultrasound, MRI and CT Scan. Outside Thimphu, Bhutanese hospitals provide only basic health care.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Bhutan. Research the altitude of your destination before travelling.  More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, emergency helicopter evacuation and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",
