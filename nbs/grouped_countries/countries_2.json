You should exercise caution and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds, political gatherings and rallies. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities. You should comply with any additional checks or security measures including curfews introduced by the authorities, which may be introduced at short notice. There were violent protests and at least two deaths related to the legislative elections which took place in April 2019.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Street crime such as robbery and mugging is a problem in Cotonou. You should avoid travelling alone and maintain a high level of vigilance, especially at night and in isolated areas, including beaches. Do not walk on the beach alone, at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Pick-pocketing occurs in areas visited by international travellers (hotels, ports, railways, beaches, bars and restaurants). Avoid Dantokpa market after dark. Be alert to the risk of car-jacking both in Cotonou and on roads outside towns and cities. When you\u2019re driving, lock vehicle windows and doors.</p>\n\n<p>In general it\u2019s better not to resist armed attack. The national police emergency number is 117 and fire is 118. You should get a police report if you report a crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"voodoo-day\">Voodoo day</h2>\n\n<p>Voodoo day is an annual public holiday celebrated by the majority of Benin\u2019s population in early January. Make sure you\u2019ve arranged suitable travel and accommodation as options are limited during the festival and watch out for pickpockets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-border-regions\">Northern border regions</h3>\n\n<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) advise against all travel to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Parc du W National Park and the contiguous hunting zones of Me\u00eakrou and Djona.

There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc</li>\n  <li>the area between the Parc du W and the border with Niger</li>\n  <li>the Pendjari National Park and adjacent hunting grounds</li>\n  <li>all other areas within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in the region. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in Benin\u2019s northern border region. On 1 May 2019, 2 French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped from Pendjari National Park. Local authorities confirmed that a body found on 4 May 2019 was that of the guide. On 11 May 2019 the hostages were rescued in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware of the risk of kidnapping and should ensure you have carefully considered the threat.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities may put curfews in place in northern Benin. You should keep up to date with security measures and follow the advice of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Benin with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Conversion to a local Benin driving licence is not required, although it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards and road conditions in Benin are poor. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit. During the rainy season (April to mid-July and mid-September to October in the South, and from June to September in the North) there are potential rain bouts which cause flooding, particularly in rural areas. Fuel shortages are common in rural areas of northern Benin.  Police sometimes carry out vehicle checks at temporary road blocks in an effort to improve road safety and reduce the number of car-jackings.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no reliable public transport in Benin. Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Avoid taxis and long distance buses as they\u2019re poorly maintained and often overloaded.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in waters off Benin and neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid swimming in the sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast.

Be especially vigilant in these locations.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a possibility that terrorist groups from neighbouring Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria may enter the border areas of northern Benin. Terrorist activity is increasing in south-eastern Burkina Faso, including confirmed attacks in the Burkina Faso part of the Parc du W. The Parc is tri-national and shares and an open border with Benin and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), who may travel across the region\u2019s porous borders. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in areas bordering the Sahel, this includes Northern Benin.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region. Further kidnaps are likely. On 1 May 2019, two French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped from Pendjari National Park. On 4 May 2019, local authorities confirmed that the guide had been found dead. On 11 May 2019, the hostages were rescued in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Burglaries and muggings have been reported on the main tourist islands of Sal and Boavista.  Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Keep sight of your belongings at all times.  Leave valuables in a hotel safe if possible and do not carry large amounts of cash. Avoid unlit areas after dark. Petty crimes e.g. pick-pocketing or handbag snatching can occur, including on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your holiday accommodation is secure. Lock all doors and windows at night and when you go out. If you\u2019re worried about security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator, hotel manager or to the owner of the property.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults are rare but they do occur. Be alert and avoid secluded stretches of the beach with limited or restricted visibility.  If you become a victim of crime, contact the local police. In an emergency call 132 (police) or 131 (fire). Response times vary and service standards may not be as high as in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Cape Verde with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Cape Verde, you\u2019ll need to get a Cape Verde driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic is usually light and main road conditions are generally of a reasonable quality.</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, scooter or quad bike, make sure it\u2019s in good condition and that it\u2019s fully insured. Quad biking is considered to be an extreme sport and may not be included in your travel insurance policy. Check whether you need additional insurance and make sure it covers you for the cost of medical care and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Crash helmets are needed by law. Your insurance policy may be invalidated if you have an accident and you\u2019re not wearing a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Cape Verde is from mid August to mid October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Intercity bus services can be dangerous due to poor driving. Taxis hailed from hotels are generally reliable. In Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition.

Take local advice before travelling by sea. Travel by sea to the southern islands of Fogo and Brava in particular can often be disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>Take care if you participate in water sports, swimming, boating and fishing. Tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Respect the warning flags and keep within sight of the lifeguard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>The political situation is generally stable, but you should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Many foreigners choose to use taxis in preference to public transport for security and convenience. Muggings and robberies (occasionally armed) also take place. Keep valuables, spare cash and spare credit cards in a safe place. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and where possible use machines that are not on the street. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewellery. Consider carrying cash and bank cards in separate pockets and only take with you the money you need at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to safeguard your possessions. Keep essential items like mobile phones or wallets out of sight. Leave your passport and other valuables in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking in downtown Asunci\u00f3n, Ciudad del Este and Pedro Juan Caballero alone during night times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n<p>Transnational criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and arms smuggling operate along Paraguay\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, especially from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina.  Their presence has increased violent crime in these areas. They have also carried out isolated violent criminal attacks in Asunci\u00f3n targeting the Paraguayan security forces and people associated with rival organisations. While tourists have not been the target of such incidents, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected and you should exercise due caution.</p>\n\n<p>A small guerrilla-style group calling itself the EPP (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo) operates in the northern part of the Department of San Pedro and southern part of the Department of Concepci\u00f3n. The group typically targets police, military and large landowners. They steal cattle and in the last decade, they have kidnapped locals for ransom, the most recent one in 2020. Three people remain in captivity. Their attacks can be violent, including the use of explosives and firearms.  Although they do not target UK nationals or tourists, you should take extra precautions if you travel to these areas.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years a small number of high profile kidnappings have occurred. Although foreigners are not routinely targeted, you should remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-crime\">Reporting crime</h3>\n<p>If you need to report a crime, you must go to the nearest police station. You can also contact the Tourist Police by phone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Asunci\u00f3n - (595 21) 446-608 or (595 21) 449-020</li>\n  <li>Ciudad del Este - (595 61) 502-715</li>\n  <li>Encarnaci\u00f3n (595 71) 204-102</li>\n  <li>Salto del Guair\u00e1 (595 46) 243-575</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-venues\">Public venues</h2>\n\n<p>Take care when visiting public venues. Markets are often located in narrow streets and can be crowded. Safety regulations may be non-existent or poorly-enforced. Food stalls burning fuel and poor electricity standards present a constant fire risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>Social conflict is not uncommon in Paraguay and blockades may occur along the main roads and in downtown Asunci\u00f3n near government buildings. Groups often use road blockades as a form of protest, without warning. Public transport can be disrupted at very short notice and demonstrations may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from urban areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid large gatherings, monitor local media and follow the guidance of local authorities in such circumstances.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can use your UK driving licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> while in Paraguay if you are visiting as a tourist. You must have your driver\u2019s licence, passport and entrance stamp with you while driving. If you hire a car, take out adequate insurance. Driving standards are poor and traffic accidents, particularly involving motorcycles, are frequent. Many motorcyclists drive with no crash helmets and some vehicles with no lights at night.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular police checks nationwide, usually to check the vehicle and drivers\u2019 documents (passport, entrance stamp, driving licence) and perform breathalyser tests. These are particularly frequent in Asunci\u00f3n, its neighbouring cities and the San Pedro and Concepci\u00f3n Departments. Take extra care when travelling in and around these areas. Take care when travelling in the departments of Alto Paran\u00e1, Concepci\u00f3n, San Pedro, Amambay, Salto del Guair\u00e1, Canindey\u00fa and the border with Bolivia where illegal cross-border activities are common.</p>\n\n<p>Paraguay\u2019s network of surfaced main roads is limited and of variable condition. Minor and rural roads remain unsurfaced and often become impassable during the rainy season and major paved roads (including in Asunci\u00f3n) are prone to flooding during heavy rain. Large potholes are a hazard on most roads including in Asunci\u00f3n. Avoid driving on country roads at night, which can be particularly hazardous.</p>\n\n<p>Stop signs, traffic lights and speed limits are often ignored and road signs indicating hazards are lacking in many areas. Road signs are generally poor and can be confusing, even for local drivers.</p>\n\n<p>Many taxis and most of the bus companies do not meet European standards and rarely have functioning seat belts. Road rules and etiquette of driving in Paraguay do not always match those of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The Terminal de Omnibus Asunci\u00f3n is the main terminal for long distance journeys. The bus station has security but you should keep a close eye on your belongings and be aware of your surroundings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"river-travel\">River travel</h2>\n<p>Boat trips and excursions are available on the main rivers, but many vessels don\u2019t meet European health and safety standards. Be cautious when swimming in rivers as many have strong currents. Avoid swimming in the River Paraguay around Asunci\u00f3n, which is highly polluted. Seek the latest official advice before swimming in the popular tourist destination of Lake Ypacara\u00ed, close to Asunci\u00f3n.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=ZP\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n",

Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country.

Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Paraguay as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/176/paraguay#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular outbreaks of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/13/dengue\">dengue fever</a>. Rain and flooding can lead to an increase in dengue carrying mosquitoes, leaving affected areas more vulnerable to dengue outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities have declared a health alert due to a number of confirmed cases of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/27/chikungunya\">Chikungunya virus</a>. You should take precautions to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-medical-care\">Local medical care</h3>\n\n<p>Facilities for good private medical care exist but are limited to the major cities. Hospitals and GPs will expect immediate payment for medical services. The availability of certain types of medicines cannot be guaranteed. Elsewhere, facilities may not meet acceptable standards. If you need a regular prescription, you should bring enough with you. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 141 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel.

They can disrupt local transport, and have the potential to escalate into violence. Don\u2019t attempt to cross protester roadblocks as this commonly provokes a violent reaction from demonstrators.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and large gatherings can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder.

However, serious crimes can and do occur. It is important to remain vigilant at all times and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant, keep all vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving, and remain aware of your surroundings, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Keep valuables and originals of important documents in a safe place and carry a copy of your passport and immigration permit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>Take care when travelling in rural parts of North Western, Copperbelt, Central and Luapula provinces close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), particularly after dark. Using legitimate border crossings in these areas is generally safe, although Congolese officials may ask for payment to cross the border. Avoid travelling in the bush along this border for hunting or prospecting.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nWild animals in the bush, including venomous snakes, are unpredictable and do kill. Whether you are travelling on land or water, you are at risk of potentially fatal animal attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Adventure sports, including in the Victoria Falls area, carry risks.\u00a0Serious accidents and deaths sometimes occur. The quality of medical care varies greatly. Follow safety instructions closely and make sure your insurance policy covers you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer, you will need to get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a Zambian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving. Vehicles are often poorly lit, inadequately maintained and badly driven. Drink driving and driving while talking on a mobile phone is illegal but commonplace. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rtsa.org.zm/\">The Road Traffic and Safety Agency</a> will prosecute traffic offenders through a fast track court system.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel at night in rural areas can be hazardous. Abandoned vehicles, pedestrians and stray animals are a danger. Many roads are severely pot-holed or otherwise unsafe, especially during the rainy season (November-April) when bridges and roads risk being washed away by sudden floods. There are frequent fatal crashes. You should avoid driving at night outside the main towns.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicle hijackings happen across the country from time to time. Take particular care when approaching locked gateways at night. Don\u2019t stop to give lifts to people at the roadside. Watch out for objects that have been placed to block the road. Be vigilant, keep all vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving, and remain aware of your surroundings, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Travel by long-distance public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions.

Facilities in rural areas are basic and emergency services are limited. You should carry basic medical supplies. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, staff at the British High Commission use the SES private ambulance service (00260 962 740300 / 740302). You should check with your insurer before travelling that your cover will be sufficient for this service. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n",

Be alert to your surroundings if you are returning to your guest house or hotel, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Keep car doors locked and windows shut, especially in heavy traffic. Keep valuables off the seats and out of sight. Gangs sometimes try to gain entry to vehicles at busy intersections in Windhoek, including during the day. Theft from vehicles, particularly at service stations, is common. If possible don\u2019t leave your vehicle unattended at fuel stops. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of thefts from mail by Post Office workers in Namibia. Any valuable parcels or documents (eg bank and credit cards) should be sent by registered mail, and preferably by a reputable commercial courier company.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t hail taxis from the street, particularly in Windhoek, as these have been involved in thefts from foreign tourists. Ask your hotel, guest house or tour operator to recommend a reputable taxi company. Don\u2019t enter townships at night unless you are accompanied by someone with local knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Safeguard your valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible. Keep large amounts of money, expensive jewellery, cameras and cell phones out of sight. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place. Beware of pickpockets in town centres.</p>\n\n<p>There have been cases of credit card skimming at some hotels and lodges around the country. When paying by credit card, keep the card in full view at all times and always check your statement carefully.</p>\n\n<p>In case of a police emergency or to report a crime in Windhoek, you can contact the Windhoek City Police Service on 061-2902911 or toll-free 302302.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ll be driving in Namibia, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is recommended. Since 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry your UK photo driving licence at all times and produce it on request at the police check points leading in and out of Windhoek and other major towns and cities. If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. If you hire a car, pay particular attention to the insurance cover provided. Most policies will not cover accidents that do not involve other vehicles or animals. Given the higher than normal probability of an accident on a gravel road because of its condition, you should take out fully comprehensive insurance on any hired vehicle. You are not allowed to use a mobile phone whilst driving.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal accidents on gravel/dirt roads. \u00a0Don\u2019t exceed 80kmh on gravel. Punctures are common. If possible, carry 2 spare tyres and plenty of water.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (normally January to April) many gravel roads deteriorate. Check with your destination on the local road conditions before setting off. \u00a0Avoid driving at night outside towns as wildlife and stray livestock pose a serious hazard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventure-sports\">Adventure sports</h3>\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance covers you for any adventure activities you plan to undertake (eg quad biking, dune boarding and hot air ballooning).</p>\n",

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Even with fully comprehensive travel insurance, private hospitals in Namibia may insist on proof of payment (cash or credit card) before starting treatment. They may also insist you pay up front, reclaiming from your insurer at a later date. Some travel insurance policies are not recognised by some Namibian hospitals, you should check with your provider if their product is accepted in Namibia before you travel and seek alternative coverage where necessary. Medical evacuation from remote areas can take time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of malaria throughout the year in the Caprivi Strip, Kavango and Kunene regions.

Make sure you carry a good supply of drinkable water.</p>\n\n<p>Namibia has one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV in the world. In 2021, the UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 210,000 adults aged 15 or over in Namibia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 11.8% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 211111 (in Windhoek) or 10111 (elsewhere) and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Before leaving the immigration desk in the airport arrivals hall, check that you have been given permission to stay in Namibia for the duration of your intended visit up to the maximum allowable of 90 days and that you have been given a correctly dated entry stamp by Namibian Immigration officials, as this will be checked on departure.\nOverstaying the time granted or an incorrect or missing entry stamp could lead to detention, arrest and a fine. If you intend to work (which includes volunteering) or stay in Namibia for a period of more than 90 days, you must get a visa from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.namibiahc.org.uk/\">Namibian High Commission</a> in London before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children-under-18\">Travelling with children (under 18)</h3>\n\n<p>Namibia introduced new immigration rules in 2016 relating to travel with children. In addition to valid passports, parents travelling with children (under 18) should at all times carry the original or certified copy of the unabridged birth certificate. The full unabridged birth certificate should list the child\u2019s details and both parents\u2019 details. The abridged (short) birth certificate which only lists the child\u2019s particulars won\u2019t be accepted by the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Adults travelling with children where they are not the biological or legal guardians of those children, should be in possession of an affidavit statement from the child\u2019s parents giving consent for their travel. If a child is travelling with only one parent, the other parent should give consent for travel in the form of an affidavit.</p>\n\n<p>Unaccompanied children may be required to provide in addition to a valid passport:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>proof of consent from one or both parents/legal guardians in the form of an affidavit</li>\n  <li>a letter from the person receiving the child including their residential address where the child will be staying</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Contact your nearest Namibian High Commission if you have any specific questions about your trip.</p>\n\n<p>If your child was born in the UK, you can order a full unabridged birth certificate online via <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate\">GOV.UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children-via-a-south-african-airport\">Travelling with children via a South African airport</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re transiting through a South African airport with children, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa\">South Africa travel advice page</a> for information and advice about the documents you\u2019ll need to carry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/157/namibia#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n",

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.

The situation remains fragile and further conflict is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care if you travel to remote areas of the country notably the border with Somaliland, the north-west of Somalia and on roads north of Tadjoura where there are military roadblocks.

Driving standards are generally poor and on the main Djibouti-Ethiopia road there are a very high number of large trucks.  Many drivers use the (legal) narcotic khat and this contributes to speeding and unsafe driving.  Roads are generally narrow, poorly lit and poorly maintained.

If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, check-in staff will register you automatically. If you do not register, you could get a fine, and face arrest and a court appearance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals do not need a visa to visit Serbia for up to 90 days. For further information on entry and exit requirements, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.london.mfa.gov.rs/\">Serbian embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to extend your stay in Serbia, you must apply for temporary residence status. You must do this at the police station where you\u2019re registered at least 30 days before the 90-day period expires.

Temporary residents should have an exit-entry visa as well as a residence stamp. If you try to leave Serbia without an entry stamp or exit-entry visa, you may face charges of illegal immigration, a heavy fine and a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>You should only enter Serbia through recognised border crossings. Serbian borders remain open for entry and exit, subject to any entry requirements currently in place in neighbouring countries.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-between-serbia-and-kosovo\">Travelling between Serbia and Kosovo</h2>\n\n<p>The authorities in Serbia do not consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official international border crossing points.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to travel from Serbia to Kosovo, and back again.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot travel from Kosovo to Serbia without a Serbian entry stamp from Belgrade, Ni\u0161 or Kraljevo airports, or one of Serbia\u2019s other border crossings with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bosnia and Herzegovina</li>\n  <li>Bulgaria</li>\n  <li>Croatia</li>\n  <li>Hungary</li>\n  <li>Montenegro</li>\n  <li>North Macedonia</li>\n  <li>Romania</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are likely to be refused entry without a valid Serbian entry stamp. You should take a route through a third country.</p>\n\n<p>Border guards have denied foreign nationals entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports. We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo can cause difficulties at border crossings with Kosovo.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/193/serbia\">check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Serbia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.carina.rs/en/passengers/passenger-customs-clearance/useful-information-for-passengers.html\">goods that can be brought into and taken out of Serbia</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>You must declare items of value if you are temporarily bringing them to Serbia to avoid customs charges \u2013 for example, jewellery, cameras and computing equipment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-money-into-serbia\">Taking money into Serbia</h2>\n\n<p>If you are carrying more than 10,000 euros (or an equal amount in other currencies), you must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>complete a declaration form at customs on arrival in Serbia \u2013 a customs officer will certify this by signing or stamping the form</li>\n  <li>keep a copy of the certified form while you are in Serbia</li>\n  <li>show the certified form when you leave Serbia</li>\n  <li>show a receipt if you are carrying Serbian dinars bought from a foreign bank</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Customs officers may seize your money if you do not follow these rules.</p>\n\n<p>You should exchange any unwanted dinars before you leave Serbia.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. Remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is the potential for disturbances in Belgrade and other towns and cities. There have been mass gatherings in Belgrade and other cities since May 2023. Further gatherings are planned. These can cause significant disruption, including to public transport. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep up to date with local developments</li>\n  <li>plan ahead to avoid disruption</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds or demonstrations to avoid injury</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities. Pickpockets work in tourist areas, airports, on public transport and at motorway petrol stations.</p>\n\n<p>As a foreigner, criminals may assume you are carrying large amounts of cash. Four-wheel drive and luxury vehicles are also popular targets.</p>\n\n<p>Some sporting events have had incidents of violence and petty crime.\nReport all incidents of crime to the local police and get a report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexploded-landmines-and-bombs\">Unexploded landmines and bombs</h2>\n\n<p>There is still some danger from unexploded landmines and bombs from the 1999 war in Kosovo and Serbia. Most of the affected areas are in the mountains to the north and east of Kosovo. Take special care in these areas and keep to marked roads.</p>\n\n<p>Thick vegetation covers most of the dangerous areas. Do not touch anything suspicious and report it to the police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to carry your passport (as a tourist) or ID card (as a resident) with you for identification purposes.  Keep a copy separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are strict penalties for possessing and trafficking drugs, including long prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles anywhere in Serbia may lead to arrest or difficulties with the authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Serbia, and there are anti-discrimination laws. There are LGBT+ friendly hostels, clubs and other events in Belgrade. However, the level of public prejudice against LGBT+ people is still relatively high. Be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Serbia. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive with a UK driving licence or <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> for a series of short visits up to a year after you first entered Serbia, or for a single stay of up to 6 months. If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, you must get a local licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Serbia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/serbia/\">RAC Serbia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The general standard of roads in Serbia varies widely. Roads are worse in rural areas, especially after bad weather. One particularly dangerous road is the Ibarska Magistrala (linking Belgrade, via \u010ca\u010dak and U\u017eice, to Montenegro).</p>\n\n<p>Dial 1987 for roadside assistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>You should only use registered taxis \u2013 look for a municipal registration number alongside the cab number. Instead of hailing a taxi, you can call one of the radio taxi phone numbers (most operators speak English). See information about taxis and public transport from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tob.rs/en/info/useful-info/taxi\">Belgrade tourism organisation</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire</h3>\n\n<p>Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow you to drive their vehicles to Kosovo, Albania or Bulgaria because of security concerns. There have been some incidents where Serbian registered cars have been vandalised, or in some cases set on fire, in more isolated areas of Kosovo.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-a-vehicle-into-serbia\">Bringing a vehicle into Serbia</h3>\n\n<p>If you are bringing a vehicle to Serbia, you must have vehicle registration and ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy. European green card vehicle insurance is now valid in Serbia, but you no longer need to hold a green card. Confirm with your insurance company that your policy covers Serbia.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.london.mfa.gov.rs/\">Serbian embassy in London</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to Serbia. The British embassy cannot help you if you arrive at the border without the correct documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Trains can be slow, particularly in winter when there are often long delays. On overnight trains, sleeping berths can be locked from the inside for safety. Each carriage has an attendant. Local police carry out random ID checks onboard trains in Serbia. Thieves operate on trains, so take particular care that documents and other valuables are safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires.  Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette are properly extinguished and do not light barbecues.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Parts of Serbia can flood after heavy rain. See flood warnings from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hidmet.gov.rs/index_eng.php\">Serbian Hydrometeorological Service</a>. If floods affect your area, follow the instructions of the Serbian authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Serbia lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but can occur. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> has advice on what to before, during and after an earthquake.</p>\n\n",

You should take sensible precautions with your personal safety. Do not walk around late at night alone. Keep valuables, particularly cameras and passports, out of sight. Keep a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport in a safe place, or with friends or family in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>A large proportion of the population has access to arms under the government of Eritrea\u2019s civilian militia programme. We have no evidence that these weapons increase the threat of violent crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-security-measures\">Local security measures</h3>\n\n<p>On 14 September 2022, the Eritrean Government announced a national call up of militia in response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\u00a0 While the call up has now ended following the peace deal between the Ethiopian Government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), extra security measures may be in place around Asmara and the rest of Eritrea.\u00a0 You should remain vigilant to the local security situation during your stay. Local travel</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are extensive mine fields in Eritrea, especially in border areas. Driving on main roads away from border areas is generally safe.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Ethiopia. All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed - travellers should check local advice before proceeding to the border.  In the border area use main paved roads and avoid driving on non-metalled roads and walking or hiking in the countryside. In September 2011, a landmine exploded on the road between Senafe and Afoma, to the east of Senafe, killing 5 people.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25 km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Djibouti. All border crossings between Djibouti and Eritrea are currently closed. In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. Though relations have improved, the situation remains unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Sudan. The border with Sudan is operational in response to the Sudanese conflict. There are ongoing reports of banditry in and around the border area.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling after dark in rural areas. Road signage and barriers are scarce, road surfaces are uneven \u2013 causing erratic driving. Tight blind bends and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country, roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely that permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-permits\">Travel Permits</h3>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave Asmara and the surrounding province of zoba Maekel. There are checkpoints outside of Asmara where your travel permit will be checked. Those working outside Asmara also need a travel permit to leave their area of residence or work. Applications in Asmara are handled by the relevant Ministry. For business travellers, applications are dealt with by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Applications outside Asmara are handled by the local Zoba (Region) Administration Offices. Permission may take several days to be granted and is sometimes refused or delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists wishing to travel outside Asmara should apply for a travel permit at the Ministry of Tourism located on Harnet Avenue in Asmara. Processing usually takes around 24 hours. When applying for permission to travel outside of Asmara, you should supply details of the car you\u2019ll be travelling in. There have been reports of tourists not being permitted to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara and have to rent a car or use a private taxi.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on travel by foreign nationals apply equally to foreign diplomats. Staff from the British Embassy are therefore unable to easily provide consular assistance to British nationals outside of Asmara.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> lists all known airlines in Eritrea that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Mariners must seek permissions and entry visas before attempting to land in Eritrea.  This includes all islands in the Red Sea that belong to Eritrea. There have been cases of mariners being detained in the last 3 years for ignoring this.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea. Those landing without a permit have previously been detained.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant.</p>\n\n<p>Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue.</p>\n\n<p>The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.  For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular Assistance</h3>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance easily to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area.</p>\n\n<p>There are obstacles to the provision of consular assistance even in Asmara. The Eritrean authorities may not inform the relevant Embassy if a foreign national is in need of help and there have been recent instances where the Eritrean authorities have refused consular access to detained foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to gain consular access to, or obtain information on dual nationals if detained by the authorities or otherwise in need of assistance.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you\u2019ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call the British Embassy on +291 1 202 838.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000.</p>\n\n<p>If you need advice which is not covered by reading our travel advice then you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Ethiopia&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Addis%20Ababa\">contact us online</a>.</p>\n\n",

Dual nationals entering Eritrea on an Eritrean identity card rather than an Eritrean passport will need an exit permit from the Immigration Office in Asmara to leave the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"foreign-currency\">Foreign currency</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors must declare all foreign currency over 10,000 US dollars or equivalent on entering the country. There is no limit on the amount that can be brought in. Make sure you have had your completed foreign currency declaration form approved and stamped before you leave the airport.</p>\n\n<p>If you declared currency on arrival, when you leave you will have to show that any foreign currency missing was exchanged at a branch of \u2019Himbol\u2019, the State foreign currency exchange. If you spend any US dollars at an official hotel you must get a receipt to present along with the currency declaration form when you leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>You are not permitted to take more than 1,000 Nafka (ERN) out of Eritrea.</p>\n\n<p>If you fail to comply with these regulations you may face prosecution leading to a heavy fine, as well as a delay to your departure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/74/eritrea#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n",

You should respect any curfews set by the Togolese authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise increased caution in the cities of Sokod\u00e9, Bafilo and Mango due to a past history of violent demonstrations where protesters and security forces have been injured and killed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime, theft and pick-pocketing are common throughout Togo and you should be especially cautious in Lom\u00e9 along the beach and in the markets. Attacks occur during daylight as well as at night. You should avoid travelling alone where possible, even within Lom\u00e9 city limits, especially at night. You should be alert to the risk of car-jackings, including through staged accidents. It\u2019s generally better not to resist armed attack.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Exit and entry points at borders can be opened and closed at short notice.

If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is also required.  This must be renewed annually.  Conversion to a local Togolese licence is not required, although it is possible. You would be required to take a driving test in Togo.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards and road conditions in Togo can be poor. Avoid travelling outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit. During the rainy season minor, unpaved roads may become impassable. You should stop at all control points on request, turn on interior vehicle lights and only continue when permission has been given to do so. You may encounter official and unofficial roadblocks.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in Togolese waters and those of neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>You should take care if you decide to swim in the  sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There are a number of drownings each year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>The number of British visitors to Togo is low. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Togo is replacing lost and stolen passports. You should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and keep  your passport in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is limited in Togo as there is no British High Commission.  The Honorary Consul in Togo can offer limited consular assistance. British nationals should contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-accra\">British High Commission in Accra, Ghana</a> who can provide consular support.</p>\n",

Some cities, including Almaty, saw violent clashes between protestors and police with deaths, injuries and arrests reported. The situation is now calm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Most visits are trouble-free. However, mugging and theft occur in cities and rural areas. Foreigners can be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent attacks and muggings on the expatriate community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan, and in Astana and Almaty. Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view. Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies have occurred on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger lists on aircraft are not always kept confidential.

You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are a single Customs Union so if you\u2019re planning to travel overland in your own vehicle make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for the entire period of stay in all three countries. Your import licence can be extended for up to a year if necessary by contacting the customs authorities in any of the three countries.</p>\n\n<p>Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Make sure you take all you need for your journey including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in good condition for lengthy journeys.</p>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly maintained and road works or damaged roads are often not clearly signposted. Driving standards can be erratic. In some remote areas there are often stray animals on the roads. These are especially difficult to see in the dark. In winter, roads can become hazardous due to snow and ice.</p>\n\n<p>Local traffic police only have the right to stop vehicles if an offence has been committed, but you should obey any request from the police to stop. The police officer should complete official papers relating to any alleged offence.</p>\n\n<p>Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when crossing roads as pedestrian crossings are rarely respected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines.

This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>You are advised to check the UK Air Safety List when flying with foreign air carriers. \u00a0The Civil Aviation Authority <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Air Safety List (ASL)</a> identifies foreign airlines which do not meet international safety standards. These airlines are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>use the list to inform your decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>consult local travel providers to find alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kazakhstan.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government advises its employees in Kazakhstan against using Petropavlovsk airport due to safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p>On 27 December 2019, an internal flight operated by the carrier \u2018Bek Air\u2019 crashed in Almaty, killing a number of people. Kazakhstan\u2019s civil aviation authority has suspended the company\u2019s licence.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.

Avoid walking in the downtown areas of Mbabane and Manzini after dark and do not travel around in remote rural areas unless in a group. There is often an increase in criminal activity during the pre-Christmas festive season.</p>\n\n<p>Keep valuables in a safe place and avoid carrying large amounts of money or wearing conspicuous jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles have been taken at gunpoint. There have been numerous incidences of car hijackings on major routes from South Africa and Mozambique and the Mbabane- Manzini corridor. Avoid travelling by car at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>There has been a series of security-related incidents over the last year, including arson attacks, targeted assassinations or kidnappings of security forces personnel, ATM robberies and retaliatory police raids. As a result, demonstrations may take place at short notice, sometimes resulting in violence between protestors and security forces that have resulted in injuries and loss of life. You should be vigilant, especially after dark and avoid protests or marches. Monitor local media and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers often cross the central reservation to avoid obstructions. Speeding is a problem (the maximum speed limit is 120 km on motorways and 80 km on other unrestricted roads). Minor roads are not well maintained and road markings are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Take care on rural roads; there have been a number of serious accidents and deaths as a result of animals straying onto roads. Avoid driving on rural roads at night. As well as the possibility of hitting animals, there is the additional risk of abandoned unlit trailers and poorly lit heavy vehicles.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nBe wary of anyone who offers you help if you breakdown or need to change a tyre as it presents the opportunity for theft, muggings and hijackings. You should park in well-lit areas. Do not pick up strangers. Do not stop to assist apparently distressed motorists, as this is a technique sometimes used by hijackers. Instead, report the incident to the police.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel in a vehicle other than one registered in Eswatini, you must carry with you in the vehicle at all times proof of your customs declaration and payment of the road fund levy. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/eswatini/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">Check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a></p>\n\n<p>Travel by public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions. However, the airport transfer coaches between Johannesburg and Mbabane are generally safe. Minibuses used in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded and poorly maintained.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The FCDO can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.

Local private hospitals can arrange evacuation but only if you are fully insured or you can produce funds in advance. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 933 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiv--aids\">HIV / AIDS</h3>\n\n<p>UNAIDS in 2015 estimated that around 210,000 adults aged 15 or over in Eswatini were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 28.8% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage rate in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning.  Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (especially churches), national parks, businesses with western interests and foreign, national and local government facilities may also be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods and during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods. On 11 June 2022, over 100 people were killed following a terrorist attack in Seytenga in the Province of Seno. Further attacks are possible. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Westerners have been kidnapped and killed in Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region. There remains a high threat of kidnap in Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou, and the wider Sahel region. Two westerners have been kidnapped in 2022 alone. There\u2019s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks, including in Ouagadougou. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism#kidnap\">Kidnap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency is currently in place in the following eight regions: Centre-Est, Est, Centre Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun, Sahel, Hauts-Bassins and Cascades. The measure gives security forces extra powers to conduct searches, restrict freedom of movement and detain persons of interest. Some civil rights may be suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large meetings. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Ouagadougou.</p>\n\n<p>Two military zones are currently in place in Soum in the north, and in the south-east on the border with Benin.

You should avoid all political rallies and gatherings, demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent.

Most incidents involve opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active in crowded places.

The scams come in many forms such as romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims.</p>\n\n<p>You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel outside of Ouagadougou against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should take professional security advice and avoid travel between towns by road at night, particularly from Bobo Dioulasso to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Fada to Benin and Togo. There is a history of violent incidents in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents are not confined to principal routes. Secondary roads (notably roads in the east to Benin, Bogand\u00e9e and Gayeri) have also been affected.</p>\n\n<p>You should also take care if you\u2019re travelling by road between Burkina Faso and Niger. Travel in convoy where possible and seek local advice before setting out. Following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country, and the number of attacks has increased in recent years. Drivers who have refused to stop for robbers have been shot at. Remote and border regions are particularly vulnerable but there have been attacks on the main road between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Burkina Faso using a UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>With a few exceptions, roads are poor with few streetlights. There is a risk of banditry and hitting stray livestock. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season (June-September). Vehicles do not always have headlights and are often in poor condition. There is a history of violent incidents along roads in areas outside Ouagadougou.</p>\n\n<p>Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads in remote areas unless travelling in convoy. If you break down off a main road you may not be able to attract help. Carry drinking water with you.</p>\n\n",

British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of kidnap is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups including Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) operate in the region. These groups rely on kidnapping for ransom to finance their activities and will continue to target foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about the threat from terrorism <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">in the Sahel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Recent kidnap incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In April 2022, a Polish national was kidnapped in north-eastern Burkina Faso and was released in June 2022. A US national was also kidnapped in Yalgo in the north-east and released in September 2022.</li>\n  <li>On 15 January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped near Gayeri in the Est region and found dead near the Niger border 2 days later.</li>\n  <li>In mid-December 2018, a Canadian and Italian were kidnapped in southwest Burkina Faso. They were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in north-east Mali after reportedly escaping.</li>\n  <li>In September 2018, 2 foreign nationals were kidnapped in the far north by an armed group.</li>\n  <li>In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, one of whom has since been released.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A number of hostages kidnapped in Burkina Faso are still being held by terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces such as places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

You should make sure you have <a href=\"/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">comprehensive contingency plans</a> that don\u2019t rely on support from the Embassy, including a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas.

These may change with little warning.

See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK Government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-nairobi\">British High Commission in Nairobi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant of the local security situation, monitor the local media, and stay in a safe location. Advice to travellers remains that you should avoid all protests and large gatherings and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.</p>\n\n<p>A ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since September 2018. However, there are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some areas of the country, as well as sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups. Serious criminality in Juba, and other urban areas, particularly during the hours of darkness, is also a regular concern. A deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy and the ongoing peace process.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a serious deterioration in the security situation, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked.  Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan\u2019s airspace.</p>\n\n<p>The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan/safety-and-security\">Safety and Security</a>. The border has now reopened following the lifting of restrictions in place in the region in response to COVID-19. To enter Uganda from South Sudan, you\u2019ll need the appropriate visa, and either (i) proof of fully vaccinated status or (ii) a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate issued no more than 72 hours before departure. Children under 5 years old are exempt from these requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in South Sudan can\u2019t be ruled out.

Weapons are plentiful and easily obtained in South Sudan and criminals are often armed. Many armed actors who are without jobs or have not been paid are resorting to criminality. Drive-by thefts by individuals or groups on motorbikes have been reported.</p>\n\n<p>South Sudan is an extremely difficult environment for businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to operate in. Although the number of aid workers killed in targeted attacks has reduced in recent years, South Sudan remains one of the most dangerous operating environments for aid workers in the world. Incidents of violence, intimidation, arbitrary detentions and kidnappings are reported, although these have mostly affected South Sudanese or regional nationals. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to South Sudan, however if you decide to travel, you should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (April to October/November) most roads outside of Juba become impassable, and some parts of the country can become inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some parts of the country, and there are sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups in certain areas. Criminal attacks have taken place on the main Juba-Nimule road, which is one of the main supply routes from Uganda into South Sudan. There are reports of mines and unexploded ordnance in parts of the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re currently in South Sudan you should exercise your own judgment, based on your knowledge of the local situation, media reporting, or advice from the UN. Our advice is that you should leave South Sudan immediately if it\u2019s safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our ability to provide assistance outside Juba is severely limited. If you\u2019re concerned about your safety, you should contact the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on +44 207 008 5000 or you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=South%20Sudan&amp;post=South%20Sudan%20travel%20advice%20team\">submit an enquiry</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving conditions and standards in South Sudan are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Very few roads are surfaced and maintained, particularly outside Juba. Residential areas usually have dirt roads. At night, there is almost no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaw-style cabs, as well as motor vehicles. Checkpoints, manned by armed men, are common around Juba, especially after dark.  There are regular reports of money being demanded from drivers, and of people (especially women) being physically abused at these checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The use of public transport should be avoided, due to the unsafe condition of vehicles, the regular occurrence of road traffic accidents (particularly on the Juba-Nimule road), and the high risk of robbery or assault on foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many don\u2019t have these. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can find a list of incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=STss\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of every individual airline, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.</p>\n\n<p>This list isn\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Following 5 years of internal conflict a peace agreement was signed in 2018 which has led to a significant reduction in violence; but slow and uneven implementation mean that the political and security situation remains volatile. The impact of the conflict, at both a national and local level, combined with a series of natural disasters (including flooding) drives a dire humanitarian situation across the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to remain in the country, maintain a high level of vigilance, follow political developments closely, and observe any curfews in place. In the event of civil disorder, stay at home and restrict your movements as much as possible, especially after dark. You should avoid all protests, political rallies and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services.</p>\n\n<p>There are credible reports of border incursions and engagements involving armed actors along all of South Sudan\u2019s frontiers, and you should exercise extreme caution in the country\u2019s border areas. A US-UK journalist was killed in August 2017 near the town of Kaya close to the Ugandan border during a gunfight between government forces and armed rebels.</p>\n\n",

Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel insurance</a> for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/country/coronavirus\">Coronavirus page</a> for COVID-19 health information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest health advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website. Each overseas territory page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in overseas territories. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the local territory government.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to get further supplies of your prescribed medicine whilst you are in the Cayman Islands, you will need to visit a registered physician, who will either countersign your UK prescription or issue a new one.  It is likely that you will have to pay for your medicine up front then submit a claim for reimbursement through your travel insurance.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>One case of dengue fever has been confirmed in the Cayman Islands so travellers should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. For more information see the website of the Health Service Authority.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-care\">Medical care</h3>\n<p>There are three well-equipped hospitals on Grand Cayman, two in the capital George Town and one in the Eastern part of the island. A smaller facility, Faith Hospital, on Cayman Brac, can cope with most routine medical and dental problems. Treatment is expensive and more serious cases will normally be stabilised in the Territory before being transferred to the United States of America.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad. Your insurance should include air ambulance,\u00a0third country (USA) medical treatment\u00a0and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the FCDO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.

A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment.

                        "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>There is a high threat from violent crime and kidnapping throughout Venezuela, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Armed robbery, mugging, carjacking, and burglary are all common and are often accompanied by extreme levels of violence \u2013 do not resist an attacker. These crimes can occur on the street or the beach, in supermarket queues or when travelling in private vehicles or public transport, or indoors.  Remain alert and avoid using your mobile phone or displaying other electronic equipment or valuables on the street or in a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Private security services, including the use of armoured cars, are increasingly becoming the standard for business and official visitors and residents. Use of armoured vehicles is now common in Caracas, especially after dark and for transport to/from the airport.</p>\n\n<p>In Caracas, reasonably priced hotels can be found in safer areas such as Chacao district.  Do not visit \u2018barrios\u2019 (heavily populated slums), not even on organised tours, as these are unsafe.  British nationals walking in the Avila National Park have been robbed at knife/gunpoint. If you want to visit the Avila then stick to popular trails and times (usually the morning) and where possible, go in a group and with someone who knows the park.</p>\n\n<p>Only use pre-booked taxis rather than hailing them in the street. Hotels will normally book a taxi from a reputable company or supply their own vehicle service.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid public transport. A number of robberies at gunpoint have been reported on the Caracas metro. There are regular reports of passengers being robbed on public buses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel\">Travel</h3>\n\n<p>The borders with Bonaire (sea) and Cura\u00e7ao (sea and air) re-opened on 3 April 2023, and borders with Aruba (sea) re-opened on 1 May 2023. The borders with Trinidad &amp; Tobago (air) re-opened from 13 May 2023. There are no direct air services between Venezuela and the USA. The land borders with Brazil and Colombia can take time to cross and can be dangerous. If you\u2019re planning travel in the region on any of these routes, contact your travel company for more information.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bol\u00edvar State. Occasionally, protests by locals have led to the closure (sometimes for days) of Canaima airport and main roads (eg parts of Road 10 between El Callao and the Brazilian border). Some  shortages of fuel and other essentials exist across parts  of the country.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of bribes being solicited by authorities at Maiquetia (Caracas) International Airport. Normal check-in for flights is 2-3 hours in advance. Police and immigration checks can be lengthy \u2013 passengers must ensure their bags pass a drugs enforcement check just after check-in. Departure taxes are normally included in the price of a ticket, except at Puerto Ordaz Airport. Check with your airline before paying anything extra.</p>\n\n<p>Do not make any non-official payments at airports and ask for a receipt for any customs duty payments you make.  If you bring any personal items or merchandise into the country with a total value of over US$1,000 which are considered to be \u201cnew\u201d, you will need to pay import duty.  Further details on import duty taxes can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://declaraciones.seniat.gob.ve/portal/page/portal/MANEJADOR_CONTENIDO_SENIAT/04ADUANAS/4.5PREGUNTAS_FRECUENT/4.5.html\">Venezuelan customs authority (SENIAT)</a> website (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>Tourist travel can often involve flying in light aircraft. There have been several accidents in recent years on the main tourist routes, including Los Roques, Canaima and Merida - some with fatalities. A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/index.php\">Aviation Safety network</a>.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out its <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">most recent audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Venezuela in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air and Avior airlines ROI (Avior Venezuela) which is banned from entering the European Union.  UK government officials have been told to avoid using both airlines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-to-and-from-maiquetia-airport-caracas\">Travelling to and from Maiquetia Airport (Caracas)</h3>\n<p>Criminal groups operate in the Maiquetia airport area. Members of these groups work inside the airport to spot passengers who appear to be wealthy and then inform car hijackers and muggers waiting on the roads outside the airport. Some passengers have been followed from the airport and assaulted on the way to or on arrival at their destination in Caracas. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery, electronic items or other valuables; don\u2019t bring large amounts of cash to Venezuela; and be alert at all times. Passengers have also been robbed when returning to their cars at the airport car park.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on the road between Caracas and Maiquetia airport during the hours of darkness. There are fewer cars on the road during this time and the risk of crime is much higher. Don\u2019t stay at an airport hotel unless you can make safe transport arrangements between the hotel and the airport.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies on buses travelling to Maiquetia Airport, and along Avenida Libertador in Caracas. Ideally, arrange to be met at the airport by friends, business contacts, or your tour operator. If that isn\u2019t possible, consider travelling by licensed taxi. If you have to take a taxi, use a licensed taxi from the official taxi rank outside the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of bogus taxi-drivers at the airport. Don\u2019t accept offers of transport in the arrivals hall and do not board a taxi if there are other passengers already inside the car.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re coming to Venezuela to work, bring a letter from your employer and your local contact organisation details (including a Spanish translation). There have been occasions when passengers have been asked for bribes at the airport. Exchange currency at official exchange booths only.</p>\n\n<p>The National Guard carries out random drug and security checks at Maiquetia Airport, particularly on departure. Departing passengers are sometimes asked to accompany an officer to a local hospital for an x-ray. Beware of bogus security officials; if you\u2019re in any doubt ask other airline or airport staff.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Heavy rains and lack of maintenance can affect road conditions. Seek local advice about your route before you set out, leave plenty of time for your journey and stick to the main roads. Avoid travelling after dark.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel and particularly to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana areas of Bol\u00edvar State. Fuel shortages are fairly common across all parts of the country although were not as severe during 2021.  Fuel is best paid in a set amount of US dollars according to how much is needed, rather than simply filling up the tank. Change will normally not be given.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Venezuela using a British driving licence for up to 1 year. After that you will need to get a Venezuelan driving licence. Make sure you have copies of insurance documents, driving licence and passport with you at all times. Failure to produce documents can result in your vehicle being seized by the police.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular police and National Guard checkpoints throughout the country. Drive slowly through these and stop if asked to do so. There have been reports of attempts by the police and National Guard to extract bribes. Ask for a written record giving details of the offence and the officer\u2019s details.</p>\n\n<p>All vehicles must carry a spare tyre, wheel block, jack and reflector triangle. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal but common, especially during weekends. Many vehicles are in poor condition and drivers routinely ignore red lights. In the event of an accident, both vehicles must remain in the position of the accident until a traffic police officer arrives. Insurance companies will not pay claims on vehicles that have been moved without a police accident report.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid hitchhiking and cycling at all costs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against boats in and around Venezuela\u2019s waters, especially east of Puerto La Cruz and in waters between Venezuela and Trinidad. Take suitable precautions and avoid these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beaches\">Beaches</h3>\n<p>The waters of the Caribbean can be deceptive. There are strong currents and undertows in some areas that can make swimming hazardous. Lifeguards and warnings are not normally in place.</p>\n\n<p>Security incidents are common on beaches at any time of day.  Beach clubs can offer better security as can going with people that know the area.</p>\n\n",

Sporadic protests may take place across Somaliland, including in Hargeisa. You should exercise a heightened level of vigilance and take care in public places where people gather.

More recently, violence broke out in Garowe, Puntland State, between pro-government and opposition forces in June 2023.</p>\n\n<p>On 11 August 2023, violent clashes occurred between the clan militia based in the Ga\u2019an Libah Mountain and the Somaliland Security Forces in Go\u2019da Yar near the mountain. On 9 August, the clan militia carried out activities in Dabagorayaale, close to Oodweyne town. Protests also took place in Burco and Erigavo.</p>\n\n<p>Renewed violence broke out between the Somaliland army and clan militias in Las Anod, Sool Region, on 6 February 2023 and is ongoing. This follows a series of violent clashes and protests in the area since December 2022. The FCDO advises against all travel to the regions of Toghdeer, Sanaag, and Sool. If you do travel the situation remains volatile, you should exercise extreme caution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n<p>Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice.

Methods of attack have included armed assaults, suicide bombings, car bombings, explosions, gun attacks, mortar attacks, improvised explosive devices and the bombing of a commercial aircraft. Attacks have previously been targeted at government officials and institutions, local and international security forces, hotels, restaurants and public transport including the international airport. Further attacks could occur at any time.</p>\n\n<p>The Somali Government regularly carries out counter-terrorist operations against al-Shabaab, particularly in areas of central and southern Somalia. Military bases and personnel are a frequent target of al-Shabaab attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks targeting places frequented by civilians are commonplace and indiscriminate.  Notable attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 9 June 2023, there was an attack on the Pearl Beach Hotel at Lido Beach in Mogadishu. It was reported that at least 9 civilians were killed and 10 injured.</li>\n  <li>on 29 October 2022, two large improvised explosive devices (IED) were used to attack the Somali Ministry of Education. Reporting indicates that over 100 civilians have been killed and 300 injured in the attack.</li>\n  <li>on 23 October 2022, there was an attack on the Tawakal Hotel in the city of Kismayo. It was reported that 13 people were killed and 47 were injured.</li>\n  <li>on 19 August 2022, there was an attack at the Hayat Hotel in central Mogadishu. It was reported that 21 were killed and 117 were injured.</li>\n  <li>on 22 April 2022, there was a bomb attack at the Pescatore Seafood Restaurant in south Mogadishu. It was reported that 8 were killed and 27 injured.</li>\n  <li>on 19 February 2022, there was a bomb attack inside Hassan Dhiif restaurant in the city of Beledweyne. It was reported that 18 were killed and 30 injured.</li>\n  <li>on 15 April 2021, there was a bomb attack on a minibus travelling between Mogadishu and Jowhar. It was reported that at least 17 people were killed and more were injured.</li>\n  <li>on 16 August 2020, there was an attack on the Elite Hotel in central Mogadishu. It was reported that 15 people were killed and at least 15 injured. The hotel is popular with foreigners.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been no major terrorist attacks in Somaliland since 2008. While attacks occur less frequently in Somaliland, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of attacks in Somalia, including Somaliland, may be further heightened during religious holidays.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnaps\">Kidnaps</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout Somalia, including in regions bordering Kenya and Ethiopia, the tri-border area, and in Somaliland. Both terrorists and criminal groups, including piracy groups, are involved in hostage-taking. A number of Western nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped in Somalia and some have been killed. Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>If you are working or travelling in Somalia, including in Somaliland, you should be aware of the risk of kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling, in crowded public places, camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",

These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You will need a visa to enter Madagascar. You can get a tourist visa on arrival at the airport. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to Madagascar are trouble-free. If possible, you should travel with established organisations or travel companies who know the terrain and have the capacity to warn of potential hazards and local customs. If hiring a guide in country, the National Tourism Office advises visitors to use the services of members of the Professional Tour Operators Association <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.top-madagascar.com/#membres\">PTO</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Presidential elections are due in November 2023. There is currently an increased  likelihood of political demonstrations and protests, particularly in the capital Antananarivo. Due to the possibility of violence at these events, you should avoid all demonstrations and protests. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security#Political-situation\">Political situation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow alerts and instructions from the local authorities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BNGRCMID\">BNGRC Facebook page</a> (in French/ Malagasy). See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Crime, particularly robbery and theft is widespread in Madagascar. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security#Crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Take great care and follow local advice in the south of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. There have been several attacks on vehicles. If travelling in the area you\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator and to avoid travelling at night. Avoid overnight stays in the countryside. You\u2019re advised not to travel by taxi-brousse (bush taxi). If you\u2019re planning to travel to Fort Dauphin you should travel by air instead of via the RN 13. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security\">Local travel - Southern Madagascar</a></p>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Madagascar, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and has occurred more than 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coast.

The first round will be held on 16 November with a second round, if needed, on 20 December. Security forces continue to be deployed in central Antananarivo in response to planned or short notice demonstrations. Security measures include the closure of roads and the use of tear gas.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the possibility of violence, stay away from large gatherings and political demonstrations, including those taking place in the area around Independence Square (\u201cLa Place du 13 mai\u201d) and the Town Hall in Antananarivo. Monitor local news, check your routes before travelling, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Robberies, theft and street crime occur frequently in towns and cities, in nature reserves and on beaches. Carjacking and theft from cars has become more frequent. Passengers in bush taxis have been robbed.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in the capital Antananarivo, particularly in markets and busy areas and especially vigilant at night. Don\u2019t touch any suspect packages.</p>\n\n<p>Never leave your bags unattended. Keep large amounts of money and valuable items including jewellery, cameras, computers and phones out of sight when walking outside. Use a hotel safe whenever possible to safeguard these items. Avoid walking alone in city centres after dark alone and be vigilant at all times. Foreigners are preferred targets for pickpockets and muggers. You should be vigilant when travelling around the city.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas like street markets and airports. You should carry your passport with you, but keep it concealed and secure. Leave copies of your travel documents, especially passports and flight tickets, in a safe place (e.g. hotel safe) and further copies with friends or family in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of acts of disorder by security personnel and avoid any actions that might antagonise them (eg taking photographs). If you\u2019re stopped by the police, show respect and stay calm. Ask for ID as there have been reports of individuals falsely claiming to be police.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re attacked, don\u2019t resist. Stay calm and consider handing over a small sum of money. Report the incident to the police and take a copy of the police report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"useful-phone-numbers\">Useful phone numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Police: 17 or 117 from a mobile phone (emergencies).</p>\n\n<p>Fire Brigade: 18 or 118 from a mobile phone.</p>\n\n<p>Gendarmerie: 19 or 119 from a mobile phone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>There have been instances of kidnapping for ransom in Madagascar. Such cases often target wealthy foreign nationals and expatriates working for large international companies.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and keep a low profile when moving around the country. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---antananarivo\">Local travel - Antananarivo</h2>\n\n<p>Since 2012 there have been occasional explosions in Antananarivo. On 7 January 2021 an explosive device detonated in the Ampasanimalo district of Antananarivo. Don\u2019t touch any suspect packages.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 July 2022, over 30 persons were killed when criminals (dahalo) set fire to buildings in a village in the district of Ankazobe, north-west of Antananarivo. Armed forces are active in the area. Tourists have not been targeted but you should seek local advice before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---northern-madagascar\">Local travel - Northern Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>A number of incidents involving violence and robberies have occurred in Nosy Be and in Ankify Port and Ambanja on the mainland. Incidents have occurred during the day on beaches and at night in crowded areas. You should be vigilant and avoid carrying large amounts of money or jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Use an official local guide and be vigilant if you\u2019re visiting the \u2018Montagne des Fran\u00e7ais\u2019.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---southern-madagascar\">Local travel - Southern Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>On 3 July 2023, ongoing demonstrations in the Lanirano area to the east of Fort Dauphin turned violent with reports of gunfire and injury to civilians. You are advised to avoid gatherings and demonstrations, and to follow advice of the local security services.</p>\n\n<p>Violent incidents involving cattle rustlers (Dahalo) have caused fatalities to the north of Fort Dauphin, around the township of Betroka, along the west coast between Belo sur Tsiribihina and Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) and in the Commune of Ilakakabe (near Isalo National Park). On 22 May 2021 a large scale attack on 3 villages in the Midongy district resulted in the deaths of 17 civilians and 2 military officers. Armed forces are active in these areas. Tourists have not been targeted but you should seek local advice before travelling and check road travel advice below. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in the Southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) and Fort-Dauphin remains tense and the roads are in a very poor condition. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator and avoid travelling at night in this area. If travelling to Fort Dauphin, you\u2019re advised to travel by air. Do not stay overnight in the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>Seek local advice and guidance before visiting beaches. You should remain vigilant when visiting beaches to the South and North of Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) as there have been attacks and robberies. Avoid visiting isolated and remote beaches, especially alone.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs are known to have attacked vehicles travelling in convoy on the RN7 (between Antananarivo and Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar). Be vigilant when visiting night clubs in Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel--western-madagascar\">Local travel \u2013 Western Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>Owing to reports of violent highway robberies, you should maintain a particularly high level of vigilance and use a recognised tour operator when travelling by road to or within western regions of Madagascar (the regions between Besalampy and Morombe) including the RN35 and RN1 (between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano). You should also maintain a high level of vigilance if you travel on the following roads: RN7, RN27, RN10 and RN34. You should avoid travelling at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---national-parks\">Local travel - National Parks</h2>\n\n<p>If you intend to visit a National Park, seek advice from a tour operator or from the park administration in advance. Maintain vigilance during your visit and do not travel at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are frequent armed robberies on main roads, particularly at night. Lock car doors and keep windows closed at all times particularly in Antananarivo. There have been attempts by young women using traffic jams to jump into vehicles and accuse men of sexual harassment. Where possible drive in convoy and avoid driving outside major  towns after dark. You should avoid travelling in multi-passenger taxi vans (known locally as taxi-brousses).</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019ve been involved in, or see an accident. Call the police (117) or drive to the next town and report to the police directly. Road conditions vary greatly. Most main roads outside Antananarivo carry heavy freight traffic, and have steep gradients and sharp bends. Drive with extreme care, especially on bridges.</p>\n\n<p>In the rainy season (December to April), many secondary roads are impassable (except by four-wheel-drive vehicles) and bridges are often washed away. \nThere are frequent road deaths involving bush taxis. If you have concerns over the safety of a vehicle or the ability of the driver, use alternative transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to drive in Madagascar you will need to get\u00a0an\u00a0 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit.</a> or apply to convert your driving licence to a Malagasy one. The import and use of right-hand drive vehicles is now banned in Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>You should be prepared to be hassled by taxi drivers. At Antananarivo airport (but not in the city), taxi fees have been officially set. Ask the taxi driver to show you the fee table. At other airports in Madagascar, haggling over the taxi fee with the driver is normal.  You should agree the fare before setting off.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Air Madagascar has been removed from the list of airlines banned from operating within the European Union. Tsaradia and Madagasikara Airways both operate internal flights within Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5R\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Madagascar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>There have been cases of armed robberies on the Tsiribihina River in western Madagascar. If you\u2019re travelling in the region you\u2019re advised to use alternative modes of transport. Operation of river ferries may be irregular. Seek local advice on ferries from Tamatave- Sonierana to Sainte Marie Island and the West Coast (Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar, Morondava, Mahajanga and Nosy Be). There have been several reported accidents with causalities due to overcrowding, poor maintenance, poor crew training and unexpected squalls. Check weather conditions locally before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stadiums-and-venues\">Stadiums and venues</h2>\n\n<p>Security and safety standards at stadiums and venues in Madagascar may be lower than in the UK. Take care if you\u2019re planning to attend events with large numbers of spectators. On 25 August 2023 there was a stadium crush at the gates of Mahamasina Stadium in the capital, Antananarivo, where at least 12 people were killed.</p>\n\n",

If you overstay, you could get a fine and possibly be deported. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or visa if you want to stay in the country for longer than planned. If you\u2019re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on visas, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uzembassy.uk/\">Uzbek Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Border guards check the stamp on exit to ensure that travellers do not exceed the 30-day period.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-uzbek-authorities\">Registering with the Uzbek authorities</h2>\n\n<p>You must register with the local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> (Department of Foreign Travel and Exit) within 3 days of your arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the 3-day period. If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, you\u2019ll be asked for your passport at check-in. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport. If you do not register within 3 days of arrival in the country, you get fined for each day you are late.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying in a private house, your host should register you directly with their local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> or on the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than 3 days, you\u2019ll need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of where you\u2019ve been in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. If you are unable to account for your whereabouts, you could get a fined for each day you are late and possibly be deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-through-uzbekistan\">Travelling through Uzbekistan</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling through Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents and camping, you must register yourself. Register online through the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>, within 3 days of arrival. When you\u2019re registering online, you\u2019ll have to pay a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment you can only pay the tourist tax online with an Uzbek debit card in local currency \u2013 seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"uzbek-british-dual-nationality\">Uzbek-British dual nationality</h2>\n\n<p>Uzbekistan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and are also a British national, the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. If you\u2019re arrested or detained, consular access is unlikely to be granted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan#Vaccine_recommendations\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Uzbekistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/%D1%9Ezbekiston-respublikasi-hududiga-kirib-kelayotgan-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-bozhhona-qoidalari\">goods you can take into or out of Uzbekistan</a> (in Uzbek and Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty, including large amounts of money.</p>\n\n<p>You must complete a customs declaration form. You should fill out 2 copies of the form. Make sure customs officials sign and stamp both copies. You\u2019ll need to show one at customs as you enter Uzbekistan and the other when you leave. If you have currency or valuables you did not declare, officials may confiscate them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-and-out-of-uzbekistan\">Taking money into and out of Uzbekistan</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to complete a foreign currency declaration form\u00a0when you arrive and keep a copy.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate form for visitors carrying significant amounts of money: the threshold is 10,000 US dollars. Visitors cannot take more than 10,000 US dollars out of the country. The forms are available in the arrival area of the airport.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot leave Uzbekistan with more foreign currency than you brought with you.</p>\n\n<p>Bring enough cash for your entire stay. Credit cards are not widely accepted outside Tashkent and the main tourist areas of Samarkand and Bukhara. Travellers cheques are not normally accepted. There are very few ATMs. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency.</p>\n\n<p>Only change money through official exchange booths. It is illegal to change money on the black market, and there are harsh penalties. Official exchange booths will not accept damaged or marked bank notes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medication\">Medication</h3>\n\n<p>Before you travel to Uzbekistan with prescription or non- prescription medicines, you should check the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan\u2019s list of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/ayrim-horizhiy-davlatlarning-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-zhoriy-qilingan-bozhhona-qoidalari\">prohibited medicines and the amount of medication you\u2019re allowed to import</a> (in Uzbek and Russian).</p>\n\n<p>You should carry a doctor\u2019s prescription if you travel with prescription medicines and declare them on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession can lead to civil or criminal proceedings\u00a0if you do not have a prescription, or if you\u2019re carrying more than you need for the visit and do not declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.</p>\n\n",

Daesh/ISIS claimed responsibility. In light of this incident, you should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation in Uzbekistan is stable.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Use caution and maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Violent crimes against foreign nationals are rare. Reports of muggings, pickpocketing, snatch-and-grab robberies, theft of unattended bags and bag snatching are more common, especially in crowded places (bazaars and public transport). Home burglaries and break-ins happen, even in wealthier neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n<p>You should use caution and take measures to protect your personal security as you would when visiting any European country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must carry your passport with you at all times.

You can get a long prison sentence if convicted.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prison-conditions\">Prison conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Prison sentences can be lengthy. While prison conditions have reportedly improved, reports of widespread hepatitis and tuberculosis and allegations of mistreatment of some prisoners by officials remain a concern.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws\">Alcohol laws</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to sell alcohol and tobacco to someone aged 19 or under.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Any form of photography can upset the authorities, particularly photographs of government buildings. This includes the Palace of Forums in Tashkent and sometimes local bazaars not normally visited by tourists. While restrictions have been relaxed recently, you should check before using a camera, especially near airports, border checkpoints, military barracks, bridges, police stations and metro stations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>You must get a licence to import drones before you arrive in Uzbekistan. If you import or use drones without permission, you can get a fine or be detained. The authorities can also confiscate your equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are illegal, not recognised and still frowned upon socially.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.

You should get your licence translated into either Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier. This is not a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Take care as many roads have poor surfaces and bad lighting.</p>\n\n<p>In Uzbekistan:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>drive on the right</li>\n  <li>vehicles approaching a roundabout have the right of way over vehicles already in the roundabout</li>\n  <li>seatbelts are compulsory for drivers and passengers</li>\n  <li>it is illegal to drive while using a mobile phone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-buses\">Taxis and buses</h3>\n\n<p>You should use licensed taxis whenever possible, this includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>official taxis at the airport</li>\n  <li>taxis hailed using apps like Yandex or My Taxi</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlicensed taxis are still common, despite licensing laws. Many taxis do not have seatbelts in the rear seat, so you may want to request a taxi that has them.</p>\n\n<p>Many buses and taxis in Uzbekistan run on compressed natural gas and safety regulations are often not followed. Where possible opt for modern vehicles.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Uzbekistan.</p>\n\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling long distances by train. If you must travel overnight, keep valuables in a safe place. Do not leave your belongings in the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.

Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. The Chinese authorities enforce public order strictly and you may face arrest, detention and/or deportation. See \u2018<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and Security\u2019</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide face-to-face assistance within China is limited, and will need to be arranged in advance. If you\u2019re in China and need consular support, call +86 (0)10 5192 4000 or the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0in London on +44 (0) 207 008 5000 or contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy and Consulates-General in Shanghai and Guangzhou provide travel documentary services to British nationals. However, you will need to make an appointment online before coming to a Consulate. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-china\">Notarial and Documentary Services Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Following protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there were reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong when the border was last open. This included reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices had been checked at border crossings. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>China has a zero tolerance policy on drugs. There are severe penalties for drugs-related offences including the death penalty. Police often raid bars and nightclubs checking for the use of illicit substances. Raids on private homes have also occurred. Police also have the power to detain or prevent you from leaving China if you are involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven\u2019t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to travel to Tibet without getting the correct permits. The Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) can be closed to foreigners without notice. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region</a>.</p>\n\n<p>China doesn\u2019t recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter China on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>. If you\u2019ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban and industrialised areas in China, and may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/beijing/\">pollution index levels</a> for many cities in real time. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/health\">Health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The typhoon season in China normally runs from May to November.

If you do, always leave your itinerary, mobile number and expected time of return at your hotel or with a third party.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of attack from armed criminals in remote areas. The areas bordering on Siberia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Laos and Burma are poorly policed. In Yunnan Province, drug smuggling and other crimes are increasing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of scams in popular tourist areas. A common example is the \u2018tea tasting\u2019 scam or \u2018massage\u2019 scam. You may be invited to visit a bar, to participate in tea tasting or for a massage, but then face demands for an exorbitant fee. This can be followed by threats or actual violence, and credit card fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Check QR code stickers on rental bicycles carefully before using them. There have been cases of the legitimate barcode being replaced with a false code, which redirects money to a different account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h2>\n<p>Before entering into a contract in China you should take legal advice, both in the United Kingdom and in China. Contracts entered into in the United Kingdom are not always enforced by Chinese courts.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute, the Chinese authorities may prohibit you from leaving China until the matter is resolved. This is known as a travel ban. For more detailed advice on business risks and commercial disputes, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/commercial-disputes-in-china\">our guide on commercial disputes in China</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of British nationals being detained against their will to extort money or intimidate them have occurred. It is rare for violence to be used, but the threat of violence is a recurring theme. You should report any threats of violence to the Chinese police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"tibet-and-the-tibet-autonomous-region-tar\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)</h3>\n\n<p>You can only travel to the TAR on an organised tour and you must get a permit first, through a specialised travel agent in China. Chinese authorities sometimes stop issuing these without notice, and also restrict travel to Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures in neighbouring Provinces, even if you have a permit.  You should check with tour operators or travel agents and monitor this travel advice and other media for information.</p>\n\n<p>Once in Tibet you should avoid demonstrations and other large public gatherings. Ongoing political and ethnic tensions can lead to unrest and protest, sometimes violent. Security measures will be tight and unauthorised gatherings may be dispersed by force. Do not film or photograph any such activities or outbreaks of violence. Local authorities will react negatively if you\u2019re found carrying letters or packages from Tibetan nationals to be posted in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>Photography in Buddhist monasteries needs permission and carries a fee.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"xinjiang-uyghur-autonomous-region\">Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region</h3>\n\n<p>There have been instances of violent unrest in Xinjiang, causing deaths. There have been allegations of the use of lethal force to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of being caught up in any unexpected demonstrations or outbreaks of violence. The Chinese authorities will increase the security presence in the area and tend to react quickly and harshly to these incidents. The Chinese authorities may restrict communications and travel to some areas of Xinjiang at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>There have been widespread arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detention in Xinjiang, mainly affecting the local population, particularly Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. You may be at increased risk if you\u2019re of Uyghur descent and/or have lived previously in Xinjiang; or if you appear to be Muslim.</p>\n\n<p>You should expect airport-style security measures, including passport and security checks, at entrances to public places such as shopping centres, markets and parks. You may need to inform the security forces of your phone number, have your photograph taken, or be questioned as to the nature of your travel. Related to reports of the use of forced labour in Xinjiang, there have been reports of due diligence auditors being detained and harassed.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times, avoid all protests and large crowds, be vigilant and monitor media reports. Do not photograph or film protests, large crowds, security officials or installations, or anything of a military nature. Mosques and other religious sites are also considered \u201csensitive\u201d sites by the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-safety\">Building safety</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-precautions\">Fire precautions\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Fire protection standards in Chinese accommodation are not always the same as in the UK. Check fire precautions including access to fire exits. Make sure your accommodation has a working fire alarm and regularly check that the fire exits aren\u2019t blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carbon-monoxide-poisoning\">Carbon monoxide poisoning</h3>\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm. There have been incidences of carbon monoxide poisoning and death due to incorrectly installed gas equipment. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.co-bealarmed.co.uk/how-to-stay-safe/\">\u2018Be Alarmed\u2019 campaign</a> gives practical advice on how to stay safe, and lists the symptoms to look out for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You need a Chinese driving licence to drive in China. You must also have valid insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Accidents are common in China due to the poor quality of roads, high volumes of traffic and generally low driving standards, so you should drive with caution. If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident, call the police. Do not move your vehicle until they arrive but make sure you and your passengers are in a safe place. In cases where there are injuries, you may be held liable for medical costs. You will also be held liable if you run over a pedestrian.</p>\n\n<p>There are harsh penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol, even at very low levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Mariners should avoid the disputed territory between China and other countries in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. There have also been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the area. See the Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org\">Information Sharing website</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>You will need to produce your passport to buy a ticket and again to board the train.</p>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are noted for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft from overnight trains is common.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>China is a one-party state. Though China is open to foreign visitors, you should be aware of political and cultural sensitivities.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. The Chinese authorities enforce public order strictly and you may face arrest, detention and/or deportation. Foreign journalists have been intimidated, assaulted or detained for trying to report demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>You may also risk becoming a target yourself when general anti-foreign sentiment runs high. Keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of the local authorities. During periods of tension, some news reporting, access to text-messaging, the internet and to international telephone lines may be blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Following protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there were reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong. This included reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices had been checked at border crossings.  You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.</p>\n",

Police carry out random checks, especially during periods of heightened security and major sporting or political events. Failure to produce your ID can lead to a fine or detention. If you renew your passport while you\u2019re in China, you must register your new passport with the authorities promptly or face a fine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"activities\">Activities</h2>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals traveling to or around areas deemed as \u201csensitive\u201d might attract greater scrutiny from the authorities, including when taking photographs near sensitive sites and when engaging with political groups or charities.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that issuing or supporting political statements critical of China, Chinese authorities, or that are deemed to be politically sensitive, including online, could be viewed as an offense under Chinese law.</p>\n\n<p>Sensitivities can change over time and may heighten around particular dates or events.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners traveling in mainland China, including but not limited to current or former employees of foreign governments, media outlets, and NGOs, might attract additional scrutiny in and around China, particularly when travelling to areas with large ethnic minority population, including but not limited to Xinjiang (see also the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region section under \u201cSafety and security\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s authorities have previously detained foreign nationals citing breach of national security legislation. Both \u2018national security\u2019 and \u2018national interest\u2019 appear regularly in Chinese legislation and have broad scope. You may be detained without having intended to break the law. Activity that occurred outside of mainland China \u2013 including online activity \u2013 could fall under scope of mainland legislation. There is a risk of arbitrary detention \u2013 including of British nationals.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on certain religious activities, including preaching and distributing religious materials. The Falun Gong movement is banned in China.</p>\n\n<p>Gambling is illegal in mainland China.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h2>\n<p>China does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you help. If you were born in China to a Chinese national parent you will be considered by the Chinese authorities to have Chinese nationality, and will be treated as a Chinese citizen, even if you used a British passport to enter China. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry clear evidence that you have done so. The FCDO has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-proceedings\">Criminal proceedings</h2>\n<p>Chinese laws and procedures relating to the arrest and detention of suspects of crime are different from in the UK. If you\u2019re suspected of a crime, the Chinese authorities have the power to prevent you from leaving China (by withholding your passport or applying a travel ban) or detaining you for up to 37 days without charge.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of an increasing number of foreign nationals subject to exit bans. Exit bans may be imposed on individuals involved in commercial or private disputes to prevent them from leaving mainland China. An exit ban can relate to investigations into an individual, their family or an employer, and can be used in criminal and civil matters, including business disputes.</p>\n\n<p>Exit bans are distinct from detention or imprisonment.\u00a0They are part of the Chinese legal process and can stay in place until resolution of the legal process in question. This means an exit ban may endure for months or years.\u00a0You may not be aware that you are subject to an exit ban until you try to leave mainland China. If you\u2019re detained on grounds of national security, which is interpreted more broadly than in the UK, you may be detained for up to 6 months before formal arrest and may be denied legal representation before charges are brought..</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h2>\n<p>There are extremely severe penalties for drugs offences in China, including the death penalty. The Chinese authorities undertake random drug testing on foreign nationals including on entry to the country. If you test positive, the Chinese authorities can prosecute you regardless of where or when you consumed drugs. Police raids on homes also occur; if drugs are found in your property, penalties can be extremely severe.</p>\n\n<p>There have been increasing incidences of police raids on nightclubs and bars. When such raids take place, patrons will be subject to on the spot drug testing and immigration checks. This may involve being kept at the location, or a secondary location, for several hours whilst hair and urine samples are taken and passport and visa checks conducted. Testing positive to drugs, or being found in breach of your visa conditions, can lead to heavy fines, detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cyber\">Cyber</h2>\n<p>The Chinese authorities maintain controls on internet access. Some services, including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are permanently blocked. Other websites may be blocked from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s cyber security laws are changing and online products and services (eg VPNs) need to be licensed by the Chinese government. More information is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.miit.gov.cn/\">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology website</a>  (in Mandarin only). Make sure you stay informed and follow Chinese law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h2>\n<p>Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention. There\u2019s no provision under Chinese legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

Chinese authorities enforce this requirement with regular spot-checks of foreigners\u2019 documentation. If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, they will do this for you as part of the check-in process.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h2>\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"working-in-china\">Working in China</h2>\n<p>You can only work in China if you have a Z visa - tourist and business visit visas do not allow you to do so. You must also hold a valid work permit. The local police regularly carry out checks on companies/schools. Violation of Chinese immigration laws can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment, fines, deportation, a travel ban preventing you from leaving China, and an exclusion order, which prevents you from returning.</p>\n\n<p>Before you leave the UK you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/\">Chinese Embassy</a> to check visa requirements. When submitting your visa application, and when you receive your work permit, check that the details are correct, including the location you\u2019ll be working in.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel.
