Terrorism There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times. UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism. Terrorism in Egypt Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt. Terrorism is a risk across Egypt, particularly in North Sinai. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include: Egyptian security forces religious sites large public gatherings places visited by foreigners The authorities in Egypt have a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers at important sites, critical infrastructure and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites. Recent attacks include: in 2022, an attack to the west of the Suez Canal targeting security forces within the city of Ismailiyah in 2019, at least 20 people killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo's Manial district in 2019, at least 16 people injured after an IED attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids in 2019, 3 security personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo's Darb al-ahmar district in 2018, a roadside blast killed 4 people on a bus near the Giza pyramids in 2018, gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Minya province killing 7 people. Daesh (formally ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack Terrorism during holiday periods There is a heightened threat of terrorism in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas in January). Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. See a list of public holidays on the Egyptian Presidency website. You should: follow the advice of Egyptian authorities be vigilant in crowds and large gatherings Airports and airlines Terrorists in Egypt have the intent and capability to target airport buildings and planes. The main threat is on the North Sinai Peninsula where Daesh operate with greater freedom, but terrorists are active throughout Egypt. Co-operate fully with security officials at airports and pay attention to security measures on flights from Egypt to the UK. Terrorist kidnap There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region's porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have taken foreigners, government officials and civilians hostage for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnappings are likely. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors.

The authorities in Egypt set and enforce entry rules. If you're not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Consulate General for Egypt in the UK. Passport validity requirements Your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive. Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. Visa requirements British passport holders travelling to Egypt normally need a visa. Visa processing fees are non-refundable. We advise you to get a visa before you travel, particularly if travelling for work or business. You can apply for a visa from the official Visa2Egypt portal or at your nearest Egyptian Consulate. Tourist visas granted using the e-visa system are valid for a maximum of 3 months. The online e-visa portal (Visa2Egypt) does not currently accept applications from variant British passport holders (those from British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies). All British passport holders can get a visa in advance by submitting an application in person or by post to the Egyptian Consulate in London. The specific requirements for the visa are listed on the website. Alternatively, if you wish to get a visa on arrival, you can do so at approved bank kiosks within airport arrival halls, before reaching immigration counters. The visa fee is 25 US dollars, payable in dollars as the preferred currency, although you may also be able to pay in pounds sterling or euros. Visas granted on arrival are valid for a maximum of 30 days. There's no need to buy a visa from an agent. In many cases agents will charge more than US$25 for a visa. If you're harassed by an agent, report the incident to the tourist police in the airport terminal. If you're travelling to Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba resorts for up to 15 days, you will receive a free entry permission stamp on arrival. If you intend to travel out of these areas or stay longer than 15 days, you must get a visa. If you have travelled to one of the South Sinai Red Sea resorts, entered without a visa and your plans have changed, you can normally purchase a visa at Sharm el Sheikh airport to allow you to travel elsewhere. Applications for visa extensions should be made at Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. You may have difficulties leaving Egypt with an out of date visa. You will normally have to pay a fine if your visa is out of date by more than 14 days. For further information and enquiries, contact the Egyptian Consulate in London. Visa extensions Apply for visa extensions at the Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. You may face difficulties if you try to leave Egypt on an expired visa.
