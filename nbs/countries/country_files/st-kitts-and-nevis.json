To drive on the island you must get a local temporary driving licence. The car hire companies will usually assist with this process. You must present a valid UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving on the roads as there can be potholes and speed bumps. Observe the speed limits. You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of an accident, call the police and don\u2019t move the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis aren\u2019t metered. Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as EC dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport is available and cheaper.
