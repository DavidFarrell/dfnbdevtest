In December 2021, President Adama Barrow secured victory in presidential elections.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid large gatherings and protests in public areas, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Attacks on tourists can occur, particularly the theft of passports and other valuables from hotel rooms. Don\u2019t take valuables or large sums of money to the beach, or display them in public. Take particular care when visiting isolated beaches and markets and crowded events and venues outside the main tourist areas, especially at night time.</p>\n\n<p>Both male and female visitors should be particularly cautious of young men locally known as \u2018bumsters\u2019 who approach tourists, particularly on beaches, offering help or to act as local guides. Be polite but firm in refusing unwanted help or attempts at conversation. Visitors should also be wary of offers, usually from \u2018bumsters\u2019, to take them on tours into Senegal. It is unlikely that the correct immigration procedures, which might include getting a visa for Senegal will be followed. This could result in detention by immigration authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave valuables in unattended vehicles. Take particular care in unlit areas or in places away from the Tourist Development Area.</p>\n\n<p>Corruption is endemic at all levels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travel in The Gambia is reasonably safe as long as you take sensible precautions to safeguard your personal possessions.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of checkpoints operating in and around the capital Banjul. Expect your vehicle to be searched if you\u2019re stopped by security forces.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for up to 3 months upon your first entry into the Gambia. After 3 months you can apply for a Gambian driving licence using your UK driving licence as proof of driving competence. You should apply to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.accessgambia.com/extra/banjul-vehicle-licensing-office.html\">the Gambia Police Force Licensing Department</a>. The documents required for the application include proof of residency in the Gambia, your valid UK driving licence and a copy of your passport.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a diplomat then you can channel your application through the Gambia Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they will advise you on what you need to provide to facilitate this process. They will process your application on your behalf. The same procedure is also applicable for International Non-Governmental Organizations, United Nations Agencies, and other diplomatic missions in the Gambia.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are bad and roads severely potholed. Driving after dark carries added hazards because of poor road and vehicle lighting. In the event of an accident, emergency medical facilities are very limited. Security checkpoints are common on all major routes in The Gambia. They are not always well sign-posted and you should take care when approaching them.</p>\n\n<p>Rainfall occurs in The Gambia between June-October. Heavy rainfall can create localised flooding. Take care if you\u2019re going up-country or travelling on non-paved roads during this period.</p>\n\n<p>Some local taxis are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-travel\">River travel</h3>\n\n<p>The ferry which crosses from Banjul to Barra is often crowded and overloaded. Safety measures and maintenance are not up to international standards and lack life-saving equipment and rescue services. Consider using the alternative route across the Senegambia Bridge near Farafenni. There have been several instances of the ferry becoming stranded on sandbanks. If using the ferry get out of your vehicle quickly after parking to avoid becoming trapped inside  your vehicle for the duration of the journey.</p>\n\n<p>Pirogues (wooden dug-out canoes) operate in The Gambia. These can be overloaded and safety measures are not up to international standards. They are not recommended for long journeys and you should make sure they have life jackets.</p>\n",

There are reports of increased child sex tourism. Report any incidences to police officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h3>\n<p>There is a zero tolerance towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in The Gambia. The Gambian criminal code states that any person who has or attempts to have \u2018carnal knowledge\u2019 of any person \u2018against the order of nature\u2019 is guilty of a crime and could face 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. The criminal code was amended in October 2014 to include Section (144A) entitled Aggravated Homosexuality which sets out 7 specific categories, including being \u201ca serial offender\u201d, where a person is \u201cliable on conviction to imprisonment for life\u201d. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Gambian law criminalises the act of men dressing as women with a 5-year jail term.</p>\n\n<p>In the years before the new government took office in 2017, some foreign nationals were detained by the police in relation to homosexuality.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
