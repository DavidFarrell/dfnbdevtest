Crime and violence does happen in some areas, but reports of crime targeting foreigners are rare. There have been occasional shootings and small explosions related to internal disputes over criminal, business or political interests.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>When visiting hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo, you should take care, particularly if hiking, and follow the signs warning about unexploded landmines and other unexploded weapons.

If you are detained, you may insist on your right to contact a British consular officer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Albania.

The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to drive in Albania.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>To import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/united-kingdom/en\">Albanian Embassy</a> in London before you leave. The British Embassy will be unable to help anyone attempting to bring a vehicle into Albania without the correct paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dangers-of-driving-in-albania\">Dangers of driving in Albania</h3>\n\n<p>Driving can be very hazardous. Roads are poor, especially in rural areas. Street lighting in urban areas is subject to power cuts. Elsewhere, even on the major inter-urban arterial routes, there is no street lighting. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked road works, potholes and unlit vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often more practical on rural and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe. Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users. If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you are supposed to wait until the police arrive. This will usually happen quickly in built-up areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-safety\">Water safety</h3>\n\n<p>There are some local press reports that jet skis and boats being rented along the coasts may lack adequate safety precautions and equipment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes and tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen.</p>\n\n<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding-and-snow\">Flooding and snow</h3>\n\n<p>From December to February, severe weather may cause flooding, particularly in northern Albania. Heavy snowfall in mountainous areas can lead to disruption to transport and services. Monitor local and international media for the latest information.</p>\n\n",
