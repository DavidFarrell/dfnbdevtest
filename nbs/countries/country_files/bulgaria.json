Visits in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Bulgarian government\u2019s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bulgarianembassy-london.org/\">Bulgarian Embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay in Bulgaria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/36/bulgaria\">check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.bg/wps/portal/agency-en/home/info-citizens/Important%20notice%20for%20travelers\">goods you can take into or out of Bulgaria</a>.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>On 30 December 2016, the Bulgarian Minister of Interior,  announced heightened security measures in all cities, winter ski resorts, and places where large gatherings are expected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities and late at night. Watch out for pickpockets and bag thefts in tourist areas, on buses and trains and major public transport hubs, including airports.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists are targeted by thieves and pickpockets in Sunny Beach and other larger cities and resorts. Do not take valuables to the beach and be wary of poorly lit roads around the resort at night. Thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach have increased.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Some tourists have been the victims of overcharging in so-called \u2018gentlemen\u2019s clubs\u2019 in Sofia and in some resorts including Bansko, Borovets and Sunny Beach. Overcharging can amount to hundreds of pounds. Victims can be threatened with violence if they refuse to pay. Seek recommendations for bars and clubs from trustworthy sources like your hotel or other holidaymakers. When paying by credit or debit card make sure the transaction is completed in your presence and be wary of attempts to make you re-enter your pin number.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property-in-bulgaria\">Buying property in Bulgaria</h3>\n\n<p>Buyers have been defrauded while buying property. Be cautious and get comprehensive legal advice before you buy. Only deal with established and reputable real estate agents or with other contacts who you know to be reliable and genuine.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in or moving to Bulgaria, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria\">living in Bulgaria</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hotels-and-accommodation\">Hotels and accommodation</h3>\n\n<p>There have been burglaries from hotel rooms in Sunny Beach. Make sure you lock your room (including windows and balcony doors) and keep valuables locked in a safe.</p>\n\n<p>There have been break-ins at properties in the residential areas of cities, and rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Distraction theft can occur, with car tyres being deliberately punctured. When drivers investigate the puncture, thieves can distract them and steal personal belongings and documents from the vehicle. If you must stop, make sure your belongings are secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stray-dogs\">Stray dogs</h3>\n\n<p>Stray dogs are common and can be dangerous.\u202fAvoid getting too close to stray dogs, especially if they are in a pack. Take any animal bites seriously and seek immediate medical advice as rabies and other animal-borne diseases are present in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Sporadic protests occur across Bulgaria, which can cause occasional disruption with roadblocks and transport links. Avoid all protests and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to carry a form of ID or copy of the information pages of your passport at all times as proof of identity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-items-illegal-in-the-uk\">Buying items illegal in the UK</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s possible to buy weapons in Bulgaria that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/import-controls-on-offensive-weapons\">are illegal in the UK</a>. Importing them could result in a prison sentence. For example, some shops in and around Burgas and Sunny Beach sell weapons like stun guns, torch stun guns, knives, pepper spray and CS gas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-sex-offences\">Illegal drugs and sex offences</h3>\n\n<p>The Bulgarian authorities treat all drug-related and sex offences very seriously. Prison sentences can be expected for any foreigners convicted of such offences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drunken-and-disorderly-behaviour\">Drunken and disorderly behaviour</h3>\n\n<p>Offences relating to drunken, disorderly behaviour and hooliganism may be treated more seriously than in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking photographs near potentially sensitive areas like military establishments. If in doubt, ask permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are not illegal, but public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and the LGBT+ community generally keeps a low profile.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few gay bars and clubs in Sofia. The city also holds the annual Sofia Pride. Sofia Pride is growing in popularity and was attended in recent years by over 10,000 people. However, it attracts some negative attention locally and is held with a heightened police presence and security measures. If you want to join the parade, read the organisers\u2019 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.sofiapride.org/terms-for-participation-and-safety-rules/\">Sofia Pride safety rules</a>. These also contain telephone numbers of local civil society organisations able to provide further advice on reporting of incidents of hate crime. In 2023, a small number of incidents of hate crime were directed at those attending events related to Sofia Pride, including visitors to Bulgaria. These mainly consisted of verbal abuse and vandalism.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes outside Sofia tend to be more conservative. There have been isolated cases of hostility towards people perceived to be from LGBT+ communities reported in Burgas and Plovdiv. You can find local information on LGBT+ issues in Bulgaria on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bghelsinki.org/en/themes/lgbti\">Bulgarian Helsinki Committee</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information for LGBT+ travellers</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ban-on-face-covering\">Ban on face covering</h3>\n\n<p>Covering your face with garments (such as a burka or similar head covering) in public places, including government buildings, streets, parks, gardens, restaurants, shops and on public transport is illegal in Bulgaria. There is a fine for covering your face in public places.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>The condition of pavements, including in the centres of big cities, can be very poor and care should be taken. Travellers with mobility difficulties may find it challenging to move around independently, including on public transport deemed to be accessible. Lifts to platforms and stations on the Sofia Metro system, are sometimes out of order. The Blue Badge Scheme operates in Bulgaria and there are often spaces reserved for badge holders in shopping centres and on-street parking locations in city-centres. Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disabled-travellers/disability-and-travel-abroad\">information for disabled travellers</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive in Bulgaria, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bulgaria/\">RAC Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>If you enter Bulgaria in a private vehicle, you must have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>your driving licence</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>all original registration and ownership documents</li>\n  <li>evidence of insurance valid in Bulgaria</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, you must have the original contract document, stating that the vehicle can be brought into Bulgaria. Border officials will impound your vehicle if they are not satisfied that you own it or have permission to use it in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles that are registered outside the EU are considered to be \u2018temporarily imported\u2019 when driven inside Bulgaria. If they are stolen whilst in Bulgaria, the owners will be liable for import duty and related taxes. This includes cars which are registered in the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Bulgaria, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria\">living in Bulgaria</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. These have replaced GB stickers. Check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">GOV.UK guidance on displaying number plates </a> for more information on driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Road conditions can be dangerous. Take care when driving, particularly at night and outside major cities. Many roads (and pavements) are in poor condition and road works are often unlit or unmarked. Driving standards are generally poor, and drivers can be aggressive, particularly on motorways. Avoid confrontations. Stick to the speed limit and make sure your vehicle is roadworthy. There are on-the-spot fines for minor violations. It is not unusual to encounter slow-moving cars and animal-drawn vehicles on the roads, particularly in rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to use motorways and main roads outside towns, you\u2019ll need to buy a vignette (ticket) in advance of your journey. The vignette is a form of toll. If you use the roads without purchasing a vignette, you will be fined. For more information on cost and where to buy a vignette, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tolltickets.com/en/country/bulgarien/\">BG Toll website</a>. You must drive with running lights or dipped beam headlights throughout the year, even during the daytime. For rules on what equipment you must carry in the vehicle, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bulgaria/\">RAC Bulgaria guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis may not be in very good condition. Most taxis are on a meter and yellow taxis are generally considered reliable. Avoid taxis parked outside hotels or in tourist areas. Ask your hotel to call a taxi or flag down a passing taxi with a green \u2018available\u2019 light in the window. Check the licence sticker and the tariffs on the window before getting in as cost can vary considerably.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behavior by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach. Use a taxi recommended by your tour operator or accommodation provider.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in unlicensed taxis from Sofia airport overcharging passengers. If you\u2019re travelling from the airport, make sure you take an official, licensed taxi. There is an official taxi rank in the arrivals hall. Check that the taxi meter is working before starting your journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-and-bus-travel\">Rail and bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves operate on trains. Make sure that documents and valuables are safe. The train system is very poor by European standards. There have been several fires on Bulgarian trains. Bulgaria has a comprehensive rail network but trains can be cancelled at short notice and rail travel is slow by European standards. For travel updates see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bdz.bg/en\">Bulgaria Railways website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Intercity bus travel is generally reliable and cheap by UK standards, but the roadworthiness of vehicles and driving standards are not always as they should be, and there have been a number of serious accidents in recent years.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>In summer and early autumn, Bulgaria is on a regular alert for wildfires. There is danger of large-scale and quick-spreading fires in forests and fields. Follow media reports and the advice of local authorities if wildfires occur in your area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Many parts of Bulgaria can flood following heavy rains. Flooding is usually localised but can occasionally be widespread and has caused deaths. Follow the weather forecast on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meteo.bg/en\">National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology</a> website, which provides detailed information and severe weather warnings for Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There are earthquakes and small tremors throughout the year, usually without consequences. The last significant earthquakes were in 1928.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s earthquake advice</a>.</p>\n\n",
