                    "body": "<h2 id=\"tribal-fighting\">Tribal Fighting</h2>\n\n<p>Outbreaks of tribal fighting are common across Papua New Guinea, especially in the settlement areas of Port Moresby and the Highlands provinces. Ethnic disputes can quickly escalate and lead to widespread destruction of property, disruption of normal services and serious injury. Stay alert, monitor local media and consult local contacts (accommodation or other service providers) before travelling to a new area. Tribal fighters and criminals in these areas may be armed. Although foreigners are not normally targeted, you should stay away from areas where tribal fighting is taking place.</p>\n\n<p>In July, the Enga Provincial Government declared a three-month daily curfew from 21:00 to 06:00 due to an escalation in tribal conflict. Travel and other restrictions may be imposed at short notice. You should take particular care throughout the province and stay away from \u00a0the area around the Porgera gold mine (currently closed), which has been subject to violent landowner disputes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Serious crime is high in the capital, Port Moresby, and in the cities of Lae and Mt Hagen. Settlement or squatter areas of towns and cities are particularly dangerous. \u2018Bush knives\u2019 (machetes) and firearms are often used in assaults and thefts. Carjacking, assault (including sexual assaults), bag snatching and robberies are common. Banks and cash machines are attractive targets for criminals. Walking after dark is particularly dangerous in Port Moresby and other urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>Known high-risk crime areas include the area around Parliament House in the Port Moresby suburb of Waigani, particularly outside of working hours, and along the highway between Lae and Nadzab Airport. Criminals use roadblocks outside towns to stop and loot vehicles and then attack the occupants.</p>\n\n<p>Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for possible new security risks. If you intend to travel in these areas, particularly after dark, take great care and consider travelling in convoy or using a security escort. Always lock car doors and keep windows up.</p>\n\n<p>There have been serious attacks and robberies along the Kokoda Track. Although community leaders have assured tourists of their safety and well-being while walking the Kokoda Track, you should take care. Avoid walking independently and travel with guides from trusted \u00a0travel companies. You can get details from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.papuanewguinea.travel/\">Papua New Guinea Tourism Authority</a> or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kokodatrackauthority.org/\">Kokoda Track Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is random, but people have been aducted by organised gangs and forced to open office safes while others are held captive until a ransom has been paid.  A foreign national was kidnapped in a remote part of Southern Highlands in February 2023. Risk of violent crime, rape and sexual assault in Papua New Guinea is high. In general:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not\u00a0carry large amounts of cash or openly display expensive jewellery and electronic equipment</li>\n  <li>be vigilant at all times and leave travel plans with friends, relatives or reliable local contacts\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Check your travel insurance before considering any travel to remote areas. The cost of rescue by boat or aircraft can be high.</p>\n\n<p>Damage caused by heavy rain and cyclones can make travel difficult.</p>\n\n<p>World War II unexploded ordnance still exists in Papua New Guinea, particularly along the Kokoda Track, at Milne Bay and Rabaul.</p>\n\n<p>Bougainville Island has previously seen a periods of separatist conflict, but has been calm since a peace agreement was signed in 2001. You should still be vigilant when travelling in Bougainville, particularly in central and southern Bougainville. The mountainous area in central Bougainville around the old Panguna mine is designated a \u2018No Go Zone\u2019, which you should not enter without prior authorisation from the Mekamui who control the border/check point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h2>\n\n<p>The land boundary between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea stretches for around 760km and is poorly defined. There are occasionally clashes along the border between the Indonesian military and the OPM (Organisasi Papua Merdeka \u2013 Free Papua Movement).</p>\n\n<p>The Papua New Guinea Government has defence units at its Wutung border post in Sandaun province. You should take extreme care and be prepared for possible sudden closure of the border crossing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Given the challenging terrain, extreme weather conditions and the condition of some remote airfields, flying in Papua New Guinea carries greater safety risks than flying in the UK. Since 2000, over 20 aircraft accidents have happened in Papua New Guinea. The worst recent crash was on 13 April 2016 when a Sunbird Aviation PNG Britten-Norman Islander aircraft crashed at Kiunga Airport in Western province, killing all 12 people on board.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is the only way to travel between Port Moresby and other provinces.  Delays and cancellations of international and domestic flights occur regularly. Check with your airline before travel and be prepared for the possibility of a lengthy wait at the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Driving is on the left. When driving, you must keep your driving licence with you at all times. You may use your UK driving licence for up to one month. Roads, especially in rural areas, are in a poor state of repair and driving is often erratic. Drivers who are involved in, or witness road accidents may find themselves at personal risk. You should seek police assistance as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use public buses known locally as PMVs. There have been incidents of armed hold-ups of PMVs and of passengers being attacked and robbed of their personal belongings. There have also been reports of occasional rape attacks on Port Moresby PMVs. Many PMVs are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis are available in some major centres, but can be badly maintained. If you use a taxi, agree a fare before setting off, irrespective of whether or not there is a meter. Where possible arrange to be met by family, friends or a hotel courtesy bus when arriving at international or domestic airports.</p>\n",

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available on our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h2>\n\n<p>Papua New Guinea suffered a serious polio outbreak in 2019 in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces and Port Moresby.</p>\n\n<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is also prevalent. Cases of drug resistant TB have been reported in Western and Gulf provinces and in Port Moresby.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Papua New Guinea as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/175/papua-new-guinea#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/chikungunya-fever.aspx\">Chikungunya virus</a> have been confirmed in Papua New Guinea. Dengue fever and malaria are also present. You should take steps to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/insect-tick-bite-avoidance/\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n\n<p>Medical facilities in Papua New Guinea are very basic. Hospitals often run out of basic drugs/supplies and suffer from power shortages. Evacuation by air ambulance to Australia is available in more serious cases. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 111 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",
