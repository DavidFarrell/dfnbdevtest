You should exercise caution and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds, political gatherings and rallies. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities. You should comply with any additional checks or security measures including curfews introduced by the authorities, which may be introduced at short notice. There were violent protests and at least two deaths related to the legislative elections which took place in April 2019.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Street crime such as robbery and mugging is a problem in Cotonou. You should avoid travelling alone and maintain a high level of vigilance, especially at night and in isolated areas, including beaches. Do not walk on the beach alone, at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Pick-pocketing occurs in areas visited by international travellers (hotels, ports, railways, beaches, bars and restaurants). Avoid Dantokpa market after dark. Be alert to the risk of car-jacking both in Cotonou and on roads outside towns and cities. When you\u2019re driving, lock vehicle windows and doors.</p>\n\n<p>In general it\u2019s better not to resist armed attack. The national police emergency number is 117 and fire is 118. You should get a police report if you report a crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"voodoo-day\">Voodoo day</h2>\n\n<p>Voodoo day is an annual public holiday celebrated by the majority of Benin\u2019s population in early January. Make sure you\u2019ve arranged suitable travel and accommodation as options are limited during the festival and watch out for pickpockets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-border-regions\">Northern border regions</h3>\n\n<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) advise against all travel to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Parc du W National Park and the contiguous hunting zones of Me\u00eakrou and Djona. The Parc is tri-national and shares an open border with Burkina Faso and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc</li>\n  <li>the area between the Parc du W and the border with Niger</li>\n  <li>the Pendjari National Park and adjacent hunting grounds</li>\n  <li>all other areas within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in the region. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in Benin\u2019s northern border region. On 1 May 2019, 2 French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped from Pendjari National Park. Local authorities confirmed that a body found on 4 May 2019 was that of the guide. On 11 May 2019 the hostages were rescued in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware of the risk of kidnapping and should ensure you have carefully considered the threat.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities may put curfews in place in northern Benin. You should keep up to date with security measures and follow the advice of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Benin with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Conversion to a local Benin driving licence is not required, although it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards and road conditions in Benin are poor. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit. During the rainy season (April to mid-July and mid-September to October in the South, and from June to September in the North) there are potential rain bouts which cause flooding, particularly in rural areas. Fuel shortages are common in rural areas of northern Benin.  Police sometimes carry out vehicle checks at temporary road blocks in an effort to improve road safety and reduce the number of car-jackings.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no reliable public transport in Benin. Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Avoid taxis and long distance buses as they\u2019re poorly maintained and often overloaded.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in waters off Benin and neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid swimming in the sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. Many drownings occur each year.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TY\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx\">IATA Operational Safety Audit</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/issa/Pages/registry.aspx?Query=all\">IATA Standard Safety Assessment</a>. These lists aren\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Benin.</p>\n\n",

Be especially vigilant in these locations.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a possibility that terrorist groups from neighbouring Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria may enter the border areas of northern Benin. Terrorist activity is increasing in south-eastern Burkina Faso, including confirmed attacks in the Burkina Faso part of the Parc du W. The Parc is tri-national and shares and an open border with Benin and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), who may travel across the region\u2019s porous borders. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in areas bordering the Sahel, this includes Northern Benin.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region. Further kidnaps are likely. On 1 May 2019, two French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped from Pendjari National Park. On 4 May 2019, local authorities confirmed that the guide had been found dead. On 11 May 2019, the hostages were rescued in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a recent increase in the number of cases of dengue reported in Cotonou and Calavi. For information and advice about the risks associated with dengue, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/27/benin#Other_risks\">visit the TravelHealthPro website</a></p>\n\n<p>Reports of a cholera outbreak continue, including fatalities. Cotonou is currently the most affected area. You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/32/cholera\">take the necessary precautions</a> and seek urgent medical attention if you become unwell.</p>\n\n<p>Water-borne diseases (including cholera), tuberculosis, lassa fever, meningitis and malaria are common.</p>\n\n<p>The 2014 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 78,000   adults aged 15 or over in Benin were living with HIV. The prevalence percentage was estimated at around 1.1% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n\n<p>Medical facilities are poor, particularly in rural areas. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation would be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Contact your insurance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
