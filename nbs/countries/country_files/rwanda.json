There have been incidents of violent clashes on the DRC-Rwanda border in recent years, and armed incursions into the southwest of Rwanda. On 10 June 2022 artillery fire from within DRC hit Rwandan territory close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze district in the North West. This follows a similar incident in May. Tourists sites have not been affected and the Rwandan government have assured residents and visitors that the area remains secure, but given instability in DRC further such incidents cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to visit areas close to the DRC or Burundi borders, such as popular tourist destinations including Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks, you should be alert to the risks and exercise caution.</p>\n\n<p>On 18 June, two people were killed and six were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a public passenger bus on Nyamagabe-Rusizi road, in Nyungwe Forest, Nyamgabe District.</p>\n\n<p>All travellers should keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>The land border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are open although the hours of operation may vary.

There can be landslides during the annual rains in late spring and autumn. Avoid road travel after dark as roads are unlit and driving standards are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Shared taxis (mini-vans) and motorbike taxis are the most common form of public transport within towns and around the country.
