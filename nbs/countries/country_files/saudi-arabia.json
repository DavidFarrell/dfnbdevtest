Many of these have been intercepted and destroyed by Saudi air defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks against critical national infrastructure are likely.  Energy facilities in the Kingdom have been targeted. Abha International Airport (Asir province) has been the target of a number of attacks, resulting in injury to civilians and the death of one.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks may be made on other locations in Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh and Jeddah, and along the Red Sea coast. There have been 11 intercepted missile attacks over Riyadh since the first missile attack on 4 November 2017, the most recent on 6 December 2021.

You should be vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The main threat is from Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL).</p>\n\n<p>The Saudi security forces have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks, but the scale of extremist activity is significant and attacks continue to take place.</p>\n\n<p>Be especially vigilant during periods of religious significance (including the holy month of Ramadan) and public holidays; terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks at these times. Terrorists previously carried out several attacks in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>There are posts on jihadist websites and social media encouraging attacks against British, western and other interests, including teachers, schools, oil workers, residential compounds, military, transport and aviation interests, as well as crowded places, including restaurants, hotels, shopping centres and mosques. Further attacks are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Saudi Arabia, you should regularly review and make sure you\u2019re satisfied with the security measures provided by the management and local authorities at the residential compound where you live, the place where you work and the school where your children study.</p>\n\n<p>Since May 2017, there have been a number of attacks in Qatif, Eastern Province. Most of these have taken place in and around Al Musarawa village in Al-Awamiya. They have included shootings by gunmen as well as the use of rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and explosive devices. The majority of those targeted have been members of the Saudi security forces. Saudi security forces have conducted a number of security operations against suspected terrorists in the area.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 21 April 2019, Saudi security officials killed 4 suspected terrorists when they attacked a security facility in the town of Al Zulfi, Riyadh province, with small arms and detonated an explosive suicide belt. Three Saudi security officials were injured in the exchange of fire. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 7 April 2019, Saudi security forces killed 2 suspected terrorists when they attacked a checkpoint in Abu Hadriya in Eastern Province using small arms. Two further suspects were arrested. During the attack, a non-Saudi civilian was killed and another injured. Two Saudi security officials sustained injuries in the exchange of fire.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n",

It may be a scam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-documents\">Personal documents</h3>\n\n<p>Keep your passport and travel documentation safe. Take photocopies and keep one copy with you, and leave a copy with friends or family. If you lose your passport during the Hajj, you will need to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) to return to the UK which costs \u00a3100. You will need to allow time for the ETD to be processed.

Fraudsters do not discriminate against age, gender or location. Many victims of fraud are over the age of 65. Fraudsters also target licensed travel companies to advertise fraudulent deals to Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>Places to perform Hajj can only be secured from the Nusuk Hajj platform. Be cautious if somebody is claiming they can secure you a place by other means.</p>\n\n<p>Check correct processes on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hajinformation.com/\">Saudi Ministry of Hajj website</a>. If you use a travel company when travelling for Umrah, you can check whether your travel agent/tour operator is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/atol-protection/\">ATOL</a> protected. This means that if the travel agency closes down while you are in Saudi Arabia you are guaranteed a flight home without having to pay any extra. If the agency closes down before you are due to travel, ATOL protection allows you to claim your money back.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t book without researching the booking process \u2013 if the offer seems too good to be true, it usually is. A recommendation from a friend or family member does not guarantee the authenticity of the outfit \u2013 a fraud may be ongoing for a while before the fraudsters take the money and disappear.</p>\n\n<p>When paying, consider carefully your method of payment. Establishing an auditable paper trail and keeping records of financial transactions will make it more difficult for you to be defrauded. Get everything in writing. Always get written terms and conditions as this details your contract with the travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you think that you have been a victim of Hajj fraud in the UK, call:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your local police</li>\n  <li>City of London Police Fraud Desk 020 7601 6999</li>\n  <li>OFT Consumer Direct 08454 04 05 06</li>\n  <li>Action Fraud 0300 123 2040</li>\n</ul>\n\n",

An EVW permits a single entry visit of up to six months. You can apply for an EVW through the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/\">visas portal</a>.  You must have a confirmed flight booking and apply for your EVW from 90 days to 48 hours prior to your trip.

A daily fine will be levied if you overstay your visa.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling for any other purpose, you should apply for a visa through visa agencies accredited to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia. If you overstay your visa you will be fined and deported.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re transiting through Saudi Arabia, you may need a transit visa if the connecting time between your flights is more than 12 hours. Once the ticket is issued, you should confirm with your airline or travel agency if you need a transit visa. You should be able to apply for a transit visa through your airline, travel agency or through an established agent via the visa section of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.mofa.gov.sa/sites/uk/EN/Pages/default.aspx\">Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel to Saudi Arabia via the causeway from Bahrain, you should check the terms of your Saudi visa before travelling. If you\u2019re planning to apply for a visa, you should seek advice (eg from your visa agent, the Saudi Embassy or your employer) about the visa options available to you. Saudi visas may only allow for entry into the country by air and may prevent you from entering across a land border including via the causeway from Bahrain.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel around the time of Hajj, check with your airline for any restrictions. In previous years, the Directorate of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia have restricted visitors who are not performing Hajj from flying to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. During this time, visitors may need a valid Hajj visa to be allowed to board flights to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. Visitors with business or visit visas will still be able to enter Saudi Arabia through other entry points.</p>\n\n<p>British residents in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/191/saudi-arabia#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-israel\">Previous travel to Israel</h3>\n\n<p>You may be refused entry to Saudi Arabia if your passport contains evidence of previous travel to Israel or indicates Israel as your birthplace.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-travellers\">Female travellers</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a female visitor arriving on a non-tourist visa, or a resident, you must be met by your sponsor on arrival.

Swearing and making rude gestures are considered offensive acts and violators can be subjected to the local laws. Penalties can vary from a fine to imprisonment and/or deported. For more information on rules of behaviour in Saudi Arabia, please refer to the official page of\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/understand\">Visit Saudi</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Local laws require men and women to dress modestly covering shoulders and knees in public, avoiding tight-fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images. It is not mandatory for female travellers to wear the traditional robe or abaya. Information on important laws and etiquette around dress codes is available to visitors on the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/\">Visit Saudi website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Both men and women are advised not to wear shorts or sleeveless tops, when going to government buildings, airports, health care facilities or malls. If you do not dress modestly, you may be asked to leave or be denied entry to these locations. Dressing modestly is important especially during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography-and-media\">Photography and media</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities. Filming or photographing government buildings, military installations, and palaces is not allowed. \u00a0You should avoid photographing local people.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to post anything online that could be seen to criticise, insult or ridicule the:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Saudi government or authorities</li>\n  <li>King, Crown Prince or Royal Family</li>\n  <li>country\u2019s culture and beliefs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could get a long prison sentence, even for posts published outside Saudi Arabia many years ago.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re likely come under more scrutiny if you\u2019re a British national who also:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>carries Saudi citizenship</li>\n  <li>has close Saudi relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you wish to carry out media activity related to the production, transmission and/or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video and/or visual information, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permission from\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gcam.gov.sa/\">the General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM)</a>\u00a0in advance. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment and a substantial fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-drivers\">Female drivers</h3>\n\n<p>As of June 2018, women are legally able to obtain a licence to drive a car, motorbikes and scooters. You should seek guidance from the local authorities on how to apply for a local licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt--sexual-relations-outside-marriage\">LGBT / Sexual relations outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual or extra-marital sexual relations, including adultery, are illegal and can be subject to severe penalties. It\u2019s also illegal to be transgender. Transgender people travelling to Saudi Arabia are likely to face significant difficulties and risks if this is discovered by the authorities. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Living together whilst unmarried is prohibited. Any intimacy in public between men and women (including between teenagers) can lead to arrest. Penalties can include arrest and a potential court case where the judgement can include a fine, a custodial sentence and deportation once the sentence is complete. This is especially so where the behaviour has caused offence.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the laws on sex outside marriage, if you become pregnant outside marriage, both you and your partner could face imprisonment and/or deportation. Doctors will ask for proof of marriage during antenatal checks. An unmarried woman who gives birth in Saudi Arabia may also encounter problems when registering the birth of the child in Saudi Arabia, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the Saudi authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate and the authorities may compare the date of the marriage against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-goods-and-customs\">Importing goods and customs</h3>\n\n<p>Saudi law prohibits the importation of weapons, alcohol, narcotics, pork and pork products, pornographic materials, distillery equipment, re-treaded or used tyres, used clothing and certain sculptures.</p>\n\n<p>Personal videos, books, and magazines may be subjected to scrutiny and be censored on arrival. In addition, electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<p>Special approval from the Saudi authorities\u2019 on items such as agricultural seeds, live animals, books, periodicals, movies, and tapes; religious books and tapes; chemicals and harmful materials; pharmaceutical products; wireless equipment and radio-controlled model airplanes, and archaeological artefacts\u2019 requires. For additional information, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.saso.gov.sa/en/pages/default.aspx\">The Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO)</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs-and-narcotics-control\">Drugs and narcotics control</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences in Saudi Arabia. The penalties for the use of, trafficking, smuggling and possession of drugs (even residual amounts) are severe.</p>\n\n<p>Punishment can include lengthy custodial sentences, heavy fines, deportation, and death penalty. For further information, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/Home/sectors/narcoticscontrol\">the Saudi Ministry of Interior</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Some prescribed and over the counter medicines may be controlled substances in Saudi Arabia. If you need to bring in controlled/prescription medication, ensure you carry your official doctor\u2019s prescription, hospital note or a letter from your GP, detailing the drug, the quantity prescribed and dosage. This note or letter should also be signed by the doctor / consultant and stamped by the hospital. A list of narcotic, psychotropic and controlled drugs where this rule applies, allowed quantities and documents to present can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sfda.gov.sa/sites/default/files/2021-09/Drug12112019e1.pdf\">the\u00a0Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority (SFDA) procedures and controls of narcotics and psychotropic substances</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>It is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. British nationals have been detained under this law, usually when they have come to the attention of the police on a related matter, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour. Penalties for the possession of, or trade in alcohol are severe. Both result in prison sentences. Do not arrive in Saudi Arabia under the influence of alcohol.  Do not bring alcohol into Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n\n<p>The public practice of any form of religion other than Islam is illegal; as is an intention to convert others. However, the Saudi authorities accept the private practice of religions other than Islam, and you can bring a religious text into the country as long as it is for your personal use. Importing larger quantities than this can carry severe penalties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-equipment\">Technical equipment</h3>\n\n<p>Binoculars should not be brought into Saudi Arabia and may be confiscated at the port of entry.</p>\n\n<p>Equipment like satellite phones, listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras or binoculars, may require a licence for use in Saudi Arabia. Seek advice from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carrying-two-passports\">Carrying two passports</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to hold two passports in Saudi Arabia. The immigration authorities will confiscate second passports if they are discovered.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry a photocopy of your passport for identification. Make sure you have included emergency contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-system-and-due-process\">Legal system and due process</h3>\n\n<p>The Saudi legal system differs in many ways from the UK. Suspects can be held without charge and are not always allowed quick access to legal representation. The Saudi authorities have detained witnesses and victims of crimes. If you need consular assistance, British Embassy staff will try to visit you as soon as they are aware of the case, but in some instances, Embassy staff have not been permitted to do so immediately or have had access limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crimes\">Financial crimes</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes, including fraud, bribery, embezzlement, giving somebody a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and \u2018security cheques\u2019) and non-payment of bills (for example hotel bills or car hire) can result in imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>Bank accounts and other assets may be frozen. You may also be liable for cheques that you have signed on behalf of a company.</p>\n\n<p>If you have unpaid loans or financial commitments you won\u2019t be able to cancel your residence permit, and may find yourself subject to a travel ban which will prevent you from travelling or leaving the country. All debts should be settled in full before you leave the country. Ask your bank for a certificate to confirm you have no outstanding debt once you have cleared the balance.</p>\n\n<p>Equally, you may find that there is a block on your government services, which prevents the renewal of your residents ID, issuing the re-entry/exit visa, or transferring to a new sponsor (employer) and any end of service benefits you may be entitled to could be used to offset the outstanding debt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone involved in a commercial dispute with a Saudi company or individual may be prevented from leaving the country pending resolution of the dispute. Government bodies often retain passports for official purposes; sponsors also sometimes retain passports, although this is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deportation\">Deportation</h3>\n\n<p>If you are found guilty of committing an offence and are sentenced to over 3 months, the Saudi authorities can deport you. In some circumstances, you can also be deported for shorter sentences. This is regardless of whether the judgement included deportation. If you are employed in Saudi Arabia this will impact your employment and may affect your ability to return to Saudi Arabia in the future.</p>\n\n",

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h3>\n\n<p>Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. Flu, colds and respiratory problems are very common. Bring basic medicines with you and consume adequate liquids and salts. During the period of Hajj and Umrah, pilgrims must have a valid certificate of vaccination against the ACWY strains of meningitis. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/hajj-and-umrah\">this NaTHNaC factsheet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/\">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</a> in patients from Saudi Arabia have been reported to the World Health Organization.

Most towns have a health centre or basic hospital. Serious cases may mean a transfer by ambulance or by air to hospitals in a major city that might be some distance away. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 997 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies are common and can be found easily, particularly in the big cities.  All hospitals will have a dispensing pharmacy and a number of international brands can be found in shopping malls and plazas. UK prescriptions are not honoured in Saudi Arabia. Prescriptions must be issued by a doctor registered and licensed by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialities (SCFHS).</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips.
