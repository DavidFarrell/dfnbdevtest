                    "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Crime levels are high, particularly in and around certain areas of Kingston and Montego Bay. Gang violence and shootings are common, and while these incidents are generally confined to inner city neighbourhoods there have been recent incidents outside of these where the risk of becoming a collateral victim does exist. Be especially cautious if you\u2019re travelling to West Kingston, Grant\u2019s Pen, August Town, Harbour View, Spanish Town and certain parts of Montego Bay, including Flankers, Barrett Town, Norwood, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem.</p>\n\n<p>The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. There are mobile police patrols, but you should take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Be vigilant at all times, even if you\u2019re staying with friends and family. Don\u2019t walk alone in isolated areas or on deserted beaches, even during the day. Take particular care when withdrawing money from ATMs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Try to vary which restaurants you use. Using the same place too often might make you a target for thieves. Avoid using buses at night.</p>\n\n<p>Most hotels and resorts are well guarded, but robberies can occur. Follow hotel security procedures. Use hotel safe, lock windows and doors and report suspicious activity. If you are in residential accommodation, make sure proper door locks and window grilles are fitted and consider employing a guard and fitting a house alarm. Gated and guarded compounds are normally the safest type of accommodation.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals and those returning to resettle permanently in Jamaica. Before returning to resettle, seek advice from the Jamaican High Commission in London and the local Jamaican Information Service. The Jamaican Constabulary Force have produced a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://jis.gov.jm/information/faqs/returning-residents-your-safety-and-security-guide-to-resettling-in-jamaica/\">safety and security guide</a> for returning citizens.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some violent incidents, including armed robbery, murder, rape and sexual assault, including the specific targeting of tourists and visitors. You should take care when using dating apps in Jamaica especially those used by the LGBT community. Criminals have used apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces and later assaulting and robbing victims. You should maintain a high level of personal safety awareness, including at popular events. The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">guidance for women travelling abroad</a> that may be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 119.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-operations\">Security operations</h3>\n\n<p>Security operations are ongoing and further activity including curfews could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you\u2019re travelling to affected areas, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.</p>\n\n<p>As part of security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica may impose a State of Emergency (SoE) or other measure with little warning. Such measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents. Police and military checkpoints may be established on roads from time to time, and full cooperation with security forces is recommended.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crowds-and-demonstrations\">Crowds and demonstrations</h2>\n<p>Public order incidents, demonstrations and large celebratory gatherings can occur across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You should avoid all demonstrations and exercise caution around large crowds; they have the potential to turn violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>The Jamaican police may impose curfews at short notice for specific towns or areas.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-and-from-norman-manley-international-airport\">Travel to and from Norman Manley International Airport</h3>\n<p>There have been outbreaks of violence in recent years in the Mountain View area on the route between Kingston and Norman Manley International Airport. Therefore, you should avoid the Mountain View Avenue route and use the alternative signposted Humming Bird route via South Camp Road instead.</p>\n\n<p>There have been police reports of British nationals being robbed when travelling to private accommodation from Norman Manley International Airport. Be especially vigilant when travelling from the airport to your accommodation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Travellers can expect delays and cancellation of flights in and out of Jamaica at short notice. These can be as a result of poor weather conditions or operational problems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive in Jamaica using a UK driving licence for up to 6 months. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Kingston, don\u2019t drive in the city. If you get lost, you risk putting yourself and your passengers in personal danger. Some hire cars and minibuses don\u2019t have seatbelts fitted in the rear. Check with the hire car company before you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Road accidents and fatalities are common. Many roads are badly maintained with poor signage. Roads in rural areas are narrow, winding and poorly lit at night. Speeding and drink-driving are common.</p>\n\n<p>Drive defensively, and take great care on the roads, whether you are in a vehicle or a pedestrian. Drivers and front seat passengers must wear seat belts at all times. Keep the windows up except when passing through a police checkpoint and doors locked. Be particularly vigilant when stopping at junctions or traffic lights. Criminals are known to use techniques which distract drivers to gain access to vehicles to steal handbags and other items of value.</p>\n\n<p>Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricanes, tropical storms and road-works can temporarily block roads. Check your route in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Only use Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) approved taxis or minibuses for excursions, airport transfers and sightseeing. Don\u2019t hail a taxi in the street and don\u2019t share a taxi with strangers. Most hotels and resorts have assigned JTB drivers who carry photo ID and display a prominent blue JTB sticker on the front windscreen.</p>\n\n",

Every year many British nationals are arrested for attempting to traffic ganja and other drugs.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2015, legislation came into force to decriminalise  possession of small amounts of ganja. Possession of up to 2 ounces will continue to be illegal, but will be punishable by a fine of JMD500 which is payable within 30 days. Severe penalties will remain in place for other drug related offences, including attempting to export narcotics.</p>\n\n<p>All prison sentences are served in Jamaica. Prison conditions are harsh. Pack all luggage yourself and don\u2019t carry anything through customs for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Local attitudes towards the LGBT community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. In Jamaica, certain same-sex sexual activity is illegal. In practice these laws are rarely enforced. However, the attitude of many Jamaicans to the LGBT community is hostile. LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon.

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.  Versions prior to 2 September 2020 will be archived as FCO travel advice.
