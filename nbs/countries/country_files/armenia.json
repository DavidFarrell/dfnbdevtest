But there are occasional incidents of pick pocketing, bag snatching, theft from cars and burglary involving British or other foreign nationals. Although tourists and foreigners have not been targeted, there is a risk of being caught up in such events and you should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>don\u2019t carry your passport, credit card, travel tickets and money together.</li>\n  <li>leave spare cash, passports and valuables in a safe place.

British consular officials can\u2019t give you money to help you return home. You can transfer money from the UK using many of the commercial money transfer agencies in Yerevan, including MoneyGram. You can also use most major credit and debit cards to obtain money from <abbr title=\"Automated Telling Machines\">ATMs</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 5km of the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and along the M16/H26 road between the towns of Ijevan and Noyemberyan.</p>\n\n<p>The border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed. There have been frequent violations of historical ceasefires between these countries from military emplacements along the border. There have been periods of increased tension which can make the security situation in border regions unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>The land border with Turkey is also closed, although there are scheduled direct flights between Yerevan and Istanbul.</p>\n\n<p>Travelling in the South Caucasus can be unpredictable and infrastructure is sometimes in a poor state of repair. You should plan your travel carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Armenia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The local standard of driving is poor. Be prepared for drivers who drive recklessly and flout traffic laws. Roads are in a poor state, particularly in the coldest months (November to February). If possible you should avoid driving outside of cities and towns in the dark because of the poor condition of the roads and lack of street lighting. If you are walking, be careful when crossing roads and use subways where available.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using local buses or minibuses as they are often poorly maintained and  overcrowded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Public transport is often overcrowded and poorly maintained. If you have to travel by train, secure your valuables, do not leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Armenia can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EK\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a list of airlines banned from operating within the EU on the\u00a0 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">European Commission website</a>. The list is based on random inspections on aircraft of airlines that operate flights to and from EU airports. The fact that an airline is not included in the list does not automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved. Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Although a ceasefire exists, the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed.</p>\n\n<p>Russian peacekeepers have been deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh, but tensions remain.  The border areas between Armenia and Azerbaijan also contain mines and unexploded ordnance. Any foreigners venturing within 5km of these borders are liable to be stopped by the police or the military.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"telephone-and-internet-communications\">Telephone and internet communications</h3>\n\n<p>Communication by telephone and e-mail can sometimes be difficult especially in the regions. Not all British mobile phones work in Armenia; check for coverage before leaving the UK if you intend to rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Access to wifi in cafes and restaurants in Yerevan is generally widespread. Outside major cities access to wifi in public places is not guaranteed. Most hotels offer a wifi service but it can sometimes be unreliable. Make sure family and friends who expect regular contact are aware of this to avoid unnecessary worry.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.
