If you already have an <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr>, it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> entitles you to state-provided medical treatment necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Poland nationals. If you do not have your card with you or you\u2019ve lost it, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-overseas-healthcare-services\">contact the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and have both before you travel. A <abbr title=\"Global Health Insurance Card\">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title=\"European Health Insurance Card\">EHIC</abbr> does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment.
