Check with your travel company or airline for changes.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be given a COVID-19 test when you enter Turkmenistan. This costs about 31 US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>If you test positive, you\u2019ll have to quarantine for 7 days in a hospital. You\u2019ll be charged for your stay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Turkmenistan, your passport must have an \u2018expiry date\u2019 more than 6 months after the end-date on your visa.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You will need a visa to enter and travel through Turkmenistan as a visitor. If you have the wrong visa or if you overstay your visa, you could be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en\">Turkmenistan Embassy in London</a> at least a month ahead of your intended travel date.</p>\n\n<p>You need a letter of invitation to support your application. For tourist visits, authorised travel agents can provide these letters.      If you are travelling on business  , you need letters from relevant government ministries or companies you want to do business with. If you want to attend an exhibition or event, the organiser normally provides visa support.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep your letter of invitation with you when you are in Turkmenistan  .</p>\n\n<p>The Turkmenistan Embassy will refer your visa application to Ashgabat for a decision, which can take up to a month. There is an accelerated 24-hour service costing about 150 US dollars.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transit-visas-and-travelling-through-turkmenistan-by-car\">Transit visas and travelling through Turkmenistan by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can use a transit visa if you will be in Turkmenistan for less than 5 days. You cannot change your transit visa to a tourist visa, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to change your route. Border officials may close Turkmen border crossings without notice.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy a transit visa at Baku seaport. If you want to travel to Azerbaijan by sea, you need to have visas for both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be charged up to 150 US dollars to bring a car into Turkmenistan by land or sea.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/228/turkmenistan\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Turkmenistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying for more than 3 days, you must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within 3 days of your arrival.</p>\n\n<p>In Ashgabat, register at the office at 57 Azadi Street. If you\u2019re not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department office. Ask your hotel manager or employer as they will need to confirm your departure date in writing. In most cases they will register your stay on your behalf. You must provide 2 passport-size photos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tourism-tax\">Tourism tax</h3>\n\n<p>On arrival, you must pay a migration fee of 14 US dollars. All foreign visitors except diplomats are also charged a \u2018tourism tax\u2019 of 2 US dollars for each day of their stay in Turkmenistan. Hotels include the tax as a separate item on your bill.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.gov.tm/en/customs-info/for-individuals\">goods you can take into or out of Turkmenistan</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Tobacco products to the amount of 2 packs\u2019 means you can bring one of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 packets of cigarettes \u2013 a total of 40 cigarettes</li>\n  <li>2 cigars</li>\n  <li>2 packs of tobacco each weighing no more than a packet of cigarettes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is illegal to give tobacco products as a gift. If you are caught, you could be fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-turkmenistan\">Taking money into Turkmenistan</h3>\n\n<p>Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based society. Carry cash and pay in the national currency, manat. Some larger hotels accept US dollars, but other outlets are only allowed to accept manat. There are harsh penalties for them if they take your payment in other currencies.</p>\n\n<p>You can exchange cash US dollars and euros for manat easily at a bank or money exchange. Bring new, clean notes as exchanges will reject damaged or marked notes. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. Manat cannot be re-converted, so exchange only as much as you need.</p>\n\n<p>There are a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat, but they can run out of manat notes. There\u2019s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction.</p>\n\n",

The borders with Afghanistan and Iran are particularly sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>The Caspian port of Turkmenbashi, and the ancient Silk Road city of Merv (Mary) are not in restricted areas. Check with your local tour guide before travelling outside the capital.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police sometimes carry out checks of identity documents. Carry a copy of the photo page of your passport at all times and keep your passport separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Ramadan in Turkmenistan in 2024 will likely begin in mid-March    and will last for 30 days. Get more advice from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in a car or taxi</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>wear revealing clothes</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink alcohol in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>parks or public squares</li>\n  <li>forests or beaches</li>\n  <li>train stations, airports or sea ports</li>\n  <li>underpasses</li>\n  <li>government offices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to smoke outside or in any communal spaces unless they contain a designated smoking area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re found guilty of possession or use of illegal drugs, you could face a lengthy prison sentence in very basic conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Check before taking photographs of or near airports, military barracks, police stations, government buildings or embassies. The guards at the presidential palace may tell you not to take pictures of it. The Turkmen can be sensitive about having their picture taken without their consent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"internet-and-mobile-network\">Internet and mobile network</h3>\n\n<p>Internet connections outside the larger hotels can be unreliable. Many social media apps and websites, including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp are blocked. Access to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail is often difficult. VPNs are illegal in Turkmenistan and are usually blocked as soon as the authorities identify them.</p>\n\n<p>There is a single state-owned mobile telephone provider, Altyn Asyr, which uses the TM CELL brand. Altyn Asyr does not provide a roaming service and the quality of the network is low.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-turkmens\">Relationships with Turkmens</h3>\n\n<p>The Turkmen authorities sometimes prosecute Turkmen women if they start a sexual relationship with a foreign man. They could give the foreign man a fine and deport him.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Male same-sex activity is illegal, punishable by a prison sentence. Same-sex relationships generally meet with disapproval in Turkmen society. Avoid showing affection in public.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and    your UK driving licence with you in the car.

Road travel at night outside cities is particularly dangerous because of the condition of the roads. There is a 60km/h speed limit in much of Ashgabat, enforced by both static speed cameras and police with mobile speed cameras. There are no signs warning of speed cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Licensed taxis are clearly identified and are white or yellow. Avoid unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Although taxis have meters, drivers will usually ask foreign nationals for a fee of around 20 manat. They might also ask for payment in US dollars, but this is illegal. Most taxi drivers do not speak much English.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes \u2013 usually tremors, but stronger earthquakes happen regularly. Ashgabat was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1948, when up to 100,000 people were killed.</p>\n\n<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n",
