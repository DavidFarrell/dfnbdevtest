Check with your travel provider before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Forest fires can lead to rockfall in mountainous areas. Official advice on the safety measures currently in place can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.waldbrandgefahr.ch/en/current-situation\">Federal Office for the Environment\u2019s website</a>. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas</li>\n  <li>make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished</li>\n  <li>not light barbecues</li>\n  <li>take care when you are travelling or hiking in a mountainous area</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Causing a forest fire when a ban on open fire is in place is illegal, even if unintentional, and can lead to fines of up to 20,000 Swiss francs.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a forest fire, call the fire department on 118.</p>\n\n<p>Forest fires can also cause travel disruption in wider areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avalanches\">Avalanches</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanches are a risk, particularly during heavy snow.  Off-piste skiing is very dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. Follow safety instructions and warnings. Consider carrying search equipment.  Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used, are the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Check the latest avalanche risk at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=alarm\">Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/home.html\">official Switzerland Tourism website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-in-switzerland\">Transport risks in Switzerland</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Switzerland, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/switzerland/\">RAC Switzerland guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting Switzerland, you can drive on a full, valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents.

UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the government guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates\">displaying number plates</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>Road users have to comply with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ch.ch/en/how-behave-road-traffic/\">Switzerland\u2019s traffic laws</a>, such as speed limits, rules on alcohol intake and child security. Traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorways\">Motorways</h3>\n\n<p>You must buy and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways or face large fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ch.ch/en/swiss-motorway-sticker/\">buy a vignette online</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-conditions\">Road conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Roads outside urban areas are narrow and winding. Road conditions can deteriorate fast (even in summer) especially during heavy rainfall and snowfall at higher altitudes. Reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Alpine winters make driving difficult. Equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains. Check road conditions before you depart.
