You risk being:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>held in detention</li>\n  <li>deported at your own expense</li>\n  <li>banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conditions in detention centres can be harsh.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/221/thailand\">check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods that can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.customs.go.th/list_strc_simple_neted.php?ini_content=individual_160503_03_160905_01&amp;lang=en&amp;left_menu=menu_individual_submenu_01_160421_01\">be brought into and taken out of Thailand</a>.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Targets might include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>security forces</li>\n  <li>government offices</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>shops and supermarkets</li>\n  <li>transport infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2019, there were a number of small explosions in Bangkok Satun City, and Phatthalung province in the south of Thailand</li>\n  <li>in 2018, there was a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation can be unpredictable and has led to periods of civil and political unrest.  A general election took place in May and the process of forming a government is ongoing. Avoid protests, political gatherings, demonstrations and marches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police may ask to check your passport. If you do not have it with you, you could be arrested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>Report any crime to the Thai police before you leave Thailand. Your case may not be investigated if you try to report it later.</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities, including the police, may pass details of a crime, including photos, to the media without a person\u2019s consent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially thieves on motorbikes</li>\n  <li>take care when travelling in open transport like tut-tuts</li>\n  <li>keep valuables secure and out of sight</li>\n  <li>avoid sleeping on buses and trains \u2013 people  have had items taken from bags while asleep</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep hold of your passport. Don\u2019t hand it over as a guarantee, for example to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses. Companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves tourists. However several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok in 2018. Take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through isolated areas alone, especially at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks can happen in tourist areas across Thailand. Attacks are most common during full moon parties or similar events, and near bars late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Drink spiking and drug-assisted sexual assault does happen in tourist areas around Thailand, with male and female victims. Do not leave your drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"be-drink-aware\">Be drink aware</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert and less aware of your environment. This can make you more vulnerable to accidents, injuries, robbery and assaults.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of credit card fraud. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming. Use an ATM in a bank and always protect your PIN.</p>\n\n<p>Be wary of job offers that appear too good to be true. People have arrived in Thailand and been illegally transported to neighbouring countries on the promise of high-paying jobs, which turn out to be scams. When you re-enter Thailand you may then be detained while your immigration status is validated.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passports confiscated by scammers</li>\n  <li>victims being held in poor living conditions</li>\n  <li>coercion into undertaking wider online scamming activity</li>\n  <li>pressure to make large payments to be released from sham jobs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention-facilities\">Detention facilities</h3>\n\n<p>Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. Detainees have died in custody.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>You should be aware of differences between UK and Thai law and local customs.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Bangkok has a video on what to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ukinthailand/videos/2132346856805703/\">Facebook \u2013 visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ukinthailand/status/1002378124200329216\">Twitter \u2013 visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticising-the-thai-monarchy\">Criticising the Thai monarchy</h3>\n\n<p>Criticising the Thai monarchy (l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9) is illegal. The law can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. British and Thai journalists, human rights defenders, and members of the public have faced charges for raising concerns, making political comments, sharing articles online that could been seen as negative towards Thailand, or making accusations about individuals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"posting-images-on-social-media\">Posting images on social media</h3>\n\n<p>Posting images on social media of people drinking alcohol or wearing clothing considered inappropriate can be illegal. Both the person who uploaded the images and the people in them could be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>While cigarettes are common, you could be fined up to 5,000 Thai baht for smoking them in public. E-cigarettes are illegal. You could be fined or imprisoned for using them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has strict laws against drug use, possession and trafficking. Possessing small quantities of illegal substances can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment. Possessing <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.siam-legal.com/litigation/criminal-defence-drug-offences-in-thailand.php\">Class A drugs</a> can lead to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Private recreational use of cannabis is legal if the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is below 0.2% by weight. Cannabis use in public places is illegal. The Ministry of Public Health has made it legal to grow, use, distribute and sell cannabis products, but this has not been enshrined in law so some restrictions may remain. Check with the local authorities if you are unsure.</p>\n\n<p>See more information on usage, and registration for distributing or selling cannabis, on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://bit.ly/3zvzpmW\">PR Thai Government (Thai Ministry of Public Health)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, sometimes leading to suicide.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand is generally a safe place for LGBT+ travellers.</p>\n\n<p>Thailand has no legislation on same-sex marriage.  Same-sex marriages are not legally recognised.  Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cites.dnp.go.th/npd_app/npd_cites/homepage/?slg=EN\">without a license</a>. Ivory trade is banned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property-in-thailand\">Buying property in Thailand</h3>\n\n<p>Buying property in Thailand is not straightforward. Make sure you understand local laws and consult a lawyer before making financial commitments. British people have been victims of property scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities\">Outdoor activities</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"elephant-treks\">Elephant treks</h3>\n\n<p>Elephant treks can be dangerous, especially if elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Use a reliable, licensed tour guide. British nationals have been seriously injured and killed because handlers have lost control of the elephant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safely\">Swimming safely</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. People have drowned in strong riptides. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow warning signs, especially red flags</li>\n  <li>only swim from approved beaches, with flags</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Jellyfish stings can be fatal. Take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving\">Diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving schools and rescue service standards are not always as high as in the UK. Check the dive operator\u2019s credentials and make sure you\u2019re covered by your insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve had no previous diving experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up</li>\n  <li>check safety equipment is available on the boat</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check that they have appropriate plans in place for emergencies, including their ability to get assistance to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-traffic-accidents\">Road traffic accidents</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has a high number of road traffic accidents, particularly with motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Thailand as one of the world\u2019s deadliest countries for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/road-safety#tab=tab_1\">fatalities on motorcycles</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licenses-and-permits\">Licenses and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Apply for a Thai driving licence or, if you already hold a UK licence, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, it could invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident or injury.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-and-motorcycle-hire\">Car and motorcycle hire</h3>\n\n<p>Motorcycles and scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and cannot be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Do not hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>\n\n<p>By law, you must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Lots of passenger boat services operate between the mainland and islands. Boats can sink or collide, which has led to fatalities, including of British nationals. Accidents are usually due to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>overloading</li>\n  <li>poor maintenance</li>\n  <li>rough seas, particularly during monsoon season</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"travellers-with-limited-mobility\">Travellers with limited mobility</h2>\n\n<p>Wheelchair access is often limited across Thailand due to uneven paving, obstacles and a lack of facilities such as lifts and ramps. This includes public transport systems. Many taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs.</p>\n\n<p>See FCDO advice on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-for-disabled-people\">disability and travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainy-season\">Rainy season</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season is generally from May to October. In Koh Samui and the south east of Thailand it is from November to March. However, the rainy season has been more unpredictable recently.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy storms cause disruption including flooding and landslides. Lakes, caves and waterfalls are particularly at risk of dangerous flash flooding.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tmd.go.th/en/\">Thai Meteorological Department</a> for weather warnings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes and tremors can happen in Northern Thailand.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://earthquaketrack.com/\">Earthquake Track</a> lists recent activity.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> for what to do in an earthquake.</p>\n",
