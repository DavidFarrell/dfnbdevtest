There is a high risk of avalanches, landslides and rockfalls. Weather can change very quickly, and heavy snowfall can block roads and trekking routes, particularly in the autumn and winter.</p>\n\n<p>At higher altitudes there is a possibility of snow in the summer months. Sunstroke and serious sunburn can also cause problems, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get adequate insurance, including for any activity at high altitude</li>\n  <li>use a reputable trekking agency</li>\n  <li>let someone know when you plan to return</li>\n  <li>not trek alone</li>\n  <li>adapt your plans to reflect local conditions and advice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In remote areas, mobile phone coverage is extremely limited, and medical facilities are basic. Some Kyrgyz mobile phones have difficulties connecting to satellite phones. The difficult terrain can make access impossible in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>There is a limited mountain rescue service staffed by volunteers. The rescue equipment they have is limited. Mountain rescue 24-hour emergency number: +996 312 651 404\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Kyrgyzstan for up to 30 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re legally required to have mandatory third-party motor vehicle insurance. This is in addition to any other motor vehicle insurance. For more information, contact insurance companies in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Petrol stations are limited in rural areas and diesel is often unavailable. Make sure you take all you need for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If the police stop you and issue a fine, they should give you a paper copy with instructions on how to pay. You can pay fines through a payment terminal\u00a0or in a bank. Do not pay cash directly to the police officers, although some may have a payment terminal you can use. Some fines may be reduced if you pay quickly. Payment terminals are available on streets and other places such as malls, grocery stores, kiosks and restaurants.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-safety\">Driving safety</h3>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly lit and maintained with road works or damaged roads often not clearly signposted. There is currently no MOT and no legal requirement for vehicles to be insured. Pedestrians often have a low awareness of road safety. Roads outside of Bishkek are often blocked by snow in winter.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving, particularly over long distances and avoid giving lifts to hitchhikers. Drivers have been robbed by people they picked up.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever possible use main roads when travelling in and around Bishkek.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Kyrgyzstan. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a 17,500 Kyrgyz som fine and have your licence revoked for 1 year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-buses\">Taxis and buses</h3>\n\n<p>You should avoid flagging down taxis. Use telephone, text messaging, or taxi services, which are more reputable and have English-speaking dispatchers.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using local buses and minibuses if possible. They are not always maintained properly and pickpockets operate on them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>In May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes buying flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Kyrgyzstan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u202fDepartment for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of earthquakes and tremors are frequent. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures and follow advice from local authorities. The\u00a0US Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0has information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avalanches-and-landslides\">Avalanches and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>In the mountains, avalanches and landslides often block roads, particularly in the spring.</p>\n\n",
