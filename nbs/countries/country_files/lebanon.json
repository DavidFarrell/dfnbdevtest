Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act \u2013 including funding and supporting proscribed organisations \u2013 may be liable to prosecution in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have particularly operated in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Tripoli</li>\n  <li>Palestinian refugee camps</li>\n  <li>areas close to the Syrian border, including around Hermel and Aarsal</li>\n  <li>Southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent terrorist-related incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, the police uncovered a terrorist network who were planning 3 simultaneous attacks in the southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n  <li>in 2021, the Lebanese Armed Forces dismantled a suspected ISIS cell accused of\u00a0 killing of a retired intelligence officer planning further attacks</li>\n  <li>in 2020, following the arrest of an individual suspected of preparing to conduct terrorist attacks in Beirut, there were police and military casualties in 2 security incidents linked to the disruption of further terrorist cells</li>\n  <li>in 2020, 3 municipal police officers were shot and killed in Kaftoun, Koura in North Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In response to events in Kaftoun, counter-terrorism operations were conducted in North Lebanon in 2020 resulting in deaths and arrests of suspected terrorists. During one arrest operation, in Beddawi (also Beddaoui) close to Tripoli, 4 members of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were killed. A further 2 LAF soldiers were killed when their checkpoint was attacked in Arman. Lebanese security authorities are at a high state of alert and are conducting security operations across Lebanon. Be vigilant and follow the advice of Lebanese authorities. Avoid large crowds, demonstrations, political gatherings and using shared public transport.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>If you notice or suspect a security incident is underway, leave the area immediately. Suspects have detonated explosives to avoid arrest. Keep clear of affected areas immediately after any attacks. Bystanders have been killed in a number of terrorist attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a threat of kidnapping in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have warned that foreigners could be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-situation\">Security situation</h2>\n\n<p>The security situation in Lebanon is volatile and can deteriorate quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Violence is very likely to occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>between security forces and protestors</li>\n  <li>between supporters of political groups</li>\n  <li>over scarce or subsidised resources</li>\n  <li>as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon#conflict-in-neighbouring-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-opts\">Conflict in neighbouring Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This often happens without warning, particularly at existing flashpoints. These confrontations have resulted in large numbers of casualties. Security forces may use tear gas and rubber bullets during clashes.</p>\n\n<p>There were heavy clashes in the areas of Tayouneh, Chiyah and Ain el Roumanneh, within Beirut on 14 October 2021. These clashes involved exchanges of live fire and resulted in fatalities and injuries. Weapons are common in Lebanon and groups such as Hizballah have arms that are beyond state control. Arguments can quickly escalate into violence, including the use of weapons, typically firearms and bladed weapons. There have been several reports over the past year of firearms being used during arguments in bars.</p>\n\n<p>Celebratory gunfire is illegal in Lebanon but remains widespread. Every year there are reported casualties.</p>\n\n<p>As well as internal Lebanese issues, regional and international developments can have an impact on the local security situation. This includes tensions with Israel, which could escalate with little warning. Events in Syria and Iraq may also impact Lebanon. You are therefore advised to monitor the regional situation whilst in Lebanon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-advice-for-british-nationals\">Security advice for British nationals</h3>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid large crowds and political gatherings</li>\n  <li>take cover in a building and move away from windows in areas where there\u2019s celebratory or other gunfire</li>\n  <li>be especially vigilant during periods of religious significance (including the holy month of Ramadan) and public holidays</li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.register.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/lebanon-20231013\">register your presence</a> You should complete this for every member of your family/group.</li>\n  <li>monitor this travel advice and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">sign up for email updates</a>\n</li>\n  <li>make sure you have correct and up-to-date travel documents, including a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">passport</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk\">visa</a>\u00a0if necessary, for yourself and anyone you are travelling with (even if they are not a British national) in case a sudden deterioration in the security situation means you need to leave Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there are widespread disturbances or the security situation deteriorates, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Beirut can provide. Be prepared to shelter in place for several days, if the security situation requires it. This means having enough essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. Do not rely on the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0being able to evacuate you in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"severe-economic-crisis\">Severe economic crisis</h2>\n\n<p>Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged and severe economic crisis. The situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate without warning.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0 economic situation may affect your ability to pay for goods and services. There is a very high rate of inflation. Banks and exchange houses can close for long periods during protests. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals so check with your bank before travelling.\u00a0US dollars are accepted in most supermarkets, restaurants and other outlets. However, it is very difficult to access US dollars locally. Many companies no longer accept credit debit cards so make sure you have enough cash for your stay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"shortages\">Shortages</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"medicine-shortages\">Medicine shortages</h3>\n\n<p>Many hospitals and other medical services are affected by fuel shortages. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/health\">healthcare facilities in Lebanon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) have become increasingly scarce due to the economic crisis. Make sure you have supplies of any medicines you need with you in Lebanon. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription medication, carry a medical certificate confirming that the medication has been prescribed for a medical condition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fuel-shortages\">Fuel shortages</h3>\n\n<p>Petrol and diesel can be difficult to access, with restrictions of supply at short notice. There are frequent, prolonged closures of fuel stations. Plan ahead and ensure you have enough fuel in your car before travelling. Arguments at fuel stations have sometimes become violent and involved weapons. Always make sure your vehicle is positioned to be able to leave a fuel queue quickly if tensions rise.</p>\n\n<p>Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport is sometimes affected by fuel shortages, which can cause air conditioning or lighting to be turned off in the terminal buildings. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon\u2019s power plants are only producing limited electricity for the national grid. This has led to prolonged power cuts across the country, with an impact on services, such as transport, internet, water and waste collection, and shops, cafes and restaurants. Check before travelling to a business, hotel or restaurant in case they are closed due to fuel shortages. Have a torch to hand at night and plan how you would leave your accommodation in the dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-with-israel\">Border with Israel</h2>\n\n<p>There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in South Lebanon, on the border with Israel. Tensions are high and events could escalate with little warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high level of tension in Lebanon due to the economic and political situation. Protests can occur without warning and may become violent. They have centred on the main cities of Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, but have occurred at other locations and may take place nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>exercise a high degree of caution</li>\n  <li>monitor local media for developments</li>\n  <li>avoid areas where demonstrations may be held, or where there are large gatherings of people</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with developments by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">getting email updates</a> when this travel advice is updated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>There is moderate risk to tourists from petty or violent crime. However, crime has increased due to the declining economic situation. Theft, vehicle theft and robbery in particular have risen. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>consider your route and vary daily routines</li>\n  <li>hide expensive-looking jewellery, which could draw unwanted attention</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large amounts of cash in public</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings when using ATMs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Members of the public have held up banks across Lebanon in order to access their savings, using both real and replica firearms. This may well continue. Be alert when in or near banks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault in public areas, including while walking in Beirut. Consider whether it is safe to walk alone, particularly in less busy areas. Due to the lack of electricity, streetlights often do not work, so streets are very dark at night. Consider taking a torch with you at night and make sure your phone is charged in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drug-smuggling-and-car-theft\">Drug smuggling and car theft</h3>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs involved in drug cultivation and smuggling operate in parts of the Beqaa Valley, especially northern Beqaa. Car theft gangs are prevalent and may carry out armed vehicle theft, particularly along sections of the international highway towards Baalbek. Vehicle thefts (including 4x4s) have increased significantly and are often targeted. Other armed crimes, such as robbery and kidnap, can occur in these areas. There are also frequent armed clashes between gangs and the security forces.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In Lebanon, Ramadan in 2024 will probably run from 9 March 2024 to 8 April 2024. During this time, be aware of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>playing loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swearing in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"diversity\">Diversity</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon\u2019s people are diverse, with many different Muslim and Christian sects represented. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and make sure your actions do not offend.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>In many areas you will find dress codes more relaxed than in other countries of the region, but you should still dress modestly when visiting religious sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possessing, using and trafficking illegal drugs (including small quantities) are all serious offences, punishable with prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-drones-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and drones in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Only take photographs in tourist sites. You could be arrested for photographing military sites. Flying drone cameras without permission is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The Lebanese Criminal Code includes a general provision concerning \u2018every sexual act against nature\u2019. Lebanese courts consider that this includes homosexuality. A criminal offence under this provision is punishable by a prison sentence of up to a year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://lebmash.org/resources-for-lgbt-individuals/\">Lebanese Medical Association for Sexual Health</a> has resources for LGBT+ people.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-abduction-and-travel-bans\">Child abduction and travel bans</h3>\n\n<p>If you have concerns about child custody, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/child-abduction-accredited-solicitors-referral-list\">get legal advice</a> \u00a0\u00a0before travelling to Lebanon about \u2018travel bans\u2019 that can be imposed by male heads of family. Even if you or your child holds a British passport you may be subject to Lebanese laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>In Lebanon a father or husband can legally arrange for a travel ban to be placed on their wife or children. If a travel ban is placed on you or your children, you will not be able to travel. If that does happen a parent should seek <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/lawyers/Lebanon/result?\">legal assistance</a> to check if the travel ban can be lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Lebanese family law is very different from UK law and particular care is needed if child custody becomes an issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a British national involved in international parental child abductions or custody disputes, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad\">contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>)</a> for assistance or call +44(0)2070085000. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has information on international parental child abduction, including how we can help. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> strongly advises against attempting to move your child yourself. This may be considered abduction (or \u2018re-abduction\u2019). This may be illegal and can put your child at risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"shared-taxis-and-unofficial-taxis\">Shared taxis and unofficial taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Do not use shared taxis or taxis hailed on the street.</p>\n\n<p>Only use taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>from recognised companies that use vetted drivers</li>\n  <li>recognised by hotels, which are safe and well-maintained</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies and physical attacks against passengers in shared taxis (known locally as service taxis) with passengers being attacked by either the driver or other passengers.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the Lebanese Interior Minister advised people in Lebanon not to use Uber taxis.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Lebanon. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Lebanon, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and the accident rate is high. Traffic lights are often switched off and not always observed. It may be better to hire a car with a driver if you\u2019re inexperienced. You must wear a seat belt (if fitted). Avoid travelling at night outside towns if possible. Vehicles with diesel engines are banned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Carry ID with you at all times and be prepared to stop at checkpoints to show your papers. The army has set up checkpoints on major and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary local licences are also available, but they take longer to get and are more expensive than an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>Protests and roadblocks may restrict travel at short notice. Major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport, have become blocked at short notice. If you\u2019re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving and allow extra time for your journey. If roads from the airport are blocked, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h3>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded bombs are present in Lebanon and are not always clearly marked. Use only well-travelled tracks and do not stray from their edges. Avoid remote abandoned properties. Use local guides and seek local knowledge if you are unsure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during summer. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. The authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling in Lebanon, familiarise yourself with local safety and emergency procedures, stay vigilant, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>For information on the risk of forest fires, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://drm.pcm.gov.lb/\">Disaster Risk Management website</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/drmleb/\">Facebook page</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/DRM_Lebanon\">Twitter account</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112 (for the fire service, call 175).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon is in an earthquake zone, but there have been no damaging tremors in recent years. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake.</a></p>\n\n<p>Lebanon experienced strong aftershocks from an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023. There is a risk of further aftershocks.</p>\n\n",

On 7 September, a number of injuries were reported. There have been reports of rounds reaching as far as Ghaziyeh Town (2km south).
