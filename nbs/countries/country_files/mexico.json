The Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office now advises against all but essential travel to the city of Acapulco.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Otis caused significant damage to infrastructure in Acapulco and along Mexico\u2019s southern coast between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado, including hotels, transport, communications, and health services. There have been reports of looting and robbery, given the scarce supplies of food, water and fuel. The National Guard have deployed to the region to help with disaster efforts.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the advice of local authorities, including the National Guard. The Mexican <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/CNPC_MX\">civil protection secretariat</a>\u00a0offers local disaster advice, including hurricane shelter\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://acapulco.gob.mx/refugios-temporales/\">locations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The 95D Federal Toll Road (Autopista Del Sol) has now reopened, but roads in the region have been subject to flooding, mudslides and traffic accidents. The Mexican Government are offering busses to Mexico City for affected tourists. For more information, stay in touch with your accommodation provider and monitor communications from local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Zihuatenejo airport is open. As of 27 October, Acapulco airport re-opened, but only for flights transporting stranded tourists back to Mexico City. Normal commercial flights are still not operating. You can find more information on the status of airports on the OMA\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OMAeropuertos\">account</a>. For further information on tourist evacuations, follow the Mexican Government SICT <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SICTmx\">account</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/VivaAerobus\">VivaAerobus</a> .</p>\n\n<p>The post-storm situation remains dangerous in Acapulco and the wider state of Guerrero. There may be further flash flooding and mudslides. Be aware that historically more accidents occur post-storm than during it. The storm is not the only hazard; many electric lines may be down and some buildings may not be structurally sound. See the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>\u00a0for further advice about how to prepare for travel during hurricane season, what to do ahead of a storm and what to expect in the aftermath of a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/safety-and-security#hurricanes\">Hurricanes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For 24/7 help for affected British people, you can call +52 55 1670 3200.

These can be tense and confrontational and could potentially turn violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. Monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities in Mexico. Participation in demonstrations may result in detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<p>Politically motivated violence can happen across the country and has recently increased. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations. If you come across protests, move away from the area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime in Mexico can pose a risk for foreigners, particularly in major cities and tourist resort areas where street crime is a serious issue.</p>\n\n<p>Many Mexican and foreign businesses choose to hire private security. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>research your destination thoroughly</li>\n  <li>only travel during daylight hours when possible</li>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>inform trusted contacts of your travel plans</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of a crime and want to report the incident, do so immediately to the nearest branch of the state prosecutor\u2019s office (\u2018Agencia del Ministerio P\u00fablico\u2019). A criminal investigation is not possible without a formal complaint to Mexican authorities. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.caepccm.df.gob.mx/\">Mexico City Command and Control Centre</a> (\u2018Centro de Atenci\u00f3n a Emergencias y Proteci\u00f3n Ciudadana de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\u2019)  has information and advice in Spanish on safety in Mexico City.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-atms\">Using ATMs</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs or exchanging money at an exchange shop (bureau de change). It\u2019s generally safer to use ATMs during daylight hours and inside shops or malls. People withdrawing money from airport money exchange shops and ATMs in various locations have later been targeted by criminals.\u00a0 Avoid withdrawing large amounts of money and be careful of your surroundings and who is around you while you are using the ATM.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing is common on the Mexico City Metro.  Avoid wearing expensive clothing, jewellery or watches. Limit the amount of cash or credit/debit cards you carry with you. Watch your briefcases and luggage, even in apparently secure places like the lobby of your hotel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of people presenting themselves as police officers trying to fine or arrest you for no reason, travellers driving rental cars have been targeted. Some police officers have extorted money from tourists, for alleged minor offences or traffic violations. If this happens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not hand over money or your passport</li>\n  <li>ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable later.</li>\n  <li>ask for identification</li>\n  <li>try to take note of the officer\u2019s name, badge number, and patrol car number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminals may attempt to contact your friends or relatives to transfer money to Mexico, this can occur following cases of phone theft or hacking, arrange with relatives and friends how you will contact them or how you would arrange to transfer money in advance.</p>\n\n<p>A common scam involves criminals phoning, acting as a distressed member of family, or an employee, claiming to be kidnapped and demanding money for their release. Thieves may also claim that a relative is being detained. If you are threatened over the phone, hang up and check on the safety of your family member or employee.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants. Travellers have been robbed or assaulted after being drugged. Tainted alcohol has caused illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Several sexual offences have happened in tourist areas outside of Mexico City. Take care even in areas close to hotels, and especially after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called \u2018express kidnapping\u2019) can happen, particularly in urban areas. Victims are forced to withdraw money from credit or debit cards at a cash point to secure their release.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term kidnapping for financial gain also happens, and there have been allegations of police officers being involved. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where you may be overheard by others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violence\">Violence</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Drug-related violence in Mexico has increased over recent years. Penalties for drug offences are severe, convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<p>Some areas of Mexico have a high crime rate due to the fighting between rival organised crime gangs. In these areas, there is a risk of being caught in the crossfire or of being mistaken for a member of a rival gang. Whilst risks are lower in tourist areas, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take advice    from local authorities or your hotel</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings at all times</li>\n  <li>use reputable tourism or transport companies</li>\n  <li>travel during the daytime where possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Stay away from isolated roads and use toll roads (\u2018cuotas\u2019) whenever possible. Keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights.</p>\n\n<p>Violent car-jackings and robberies happen along the Pacific Highway, if you suspect you\u2019re being followed or watched, drive to a police station or other safe place. Targets have included large camper vans or sports utility vehicles (SUVs).</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of criminals deliberately causing traffic accidents in order to make insurance claims or request cash from the other party. They are sometimes accompanied by threats of violence or intimidation. Contact the authorities for support where necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert on public transport, at airports and in bus stations. Theft on buses is common, so always keep your belongings safe.</p>\n\n<p>Buses have also been hijacked. Try to travel on first-class buses using toll roads, which have a lower rate of incidents than second and third-class buses travelling on the less secure free (\u2018libre\u2019) roads. Most first-class bus companies perform security checks when passengers board the bus.</p>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone on public transport have been targeted with harassment, robbery and sexual assault.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>If you require information on procedures, local laws, development of current events or social services you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mexicocity.cdmx.gob.mx/e/about/about-locatel/#:~:text=LOCATEL%20is%20the%20Mexico%20City,and%20institutions%20of%20Mexico%20City.\">contact Mexico City\u2019s public telephone service LOCATEL</a> on 5658 1111. They have English-speaking staff available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>If requested by Mexican authorities, you will need to provide your passport and stamp to prove your entrance and stay, copies and photos are not accepted. To demonstrate your visa status, you can get a digital registry of your entry documents from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inm.gob.mx/spublic/portal/inmex.html\">Portal de Servicios INM</a>. If you are unable to produce these documents, you may be questioned by Immigration officers and held in a detention centre while the authorities check your immigration status. Depending on the outcome, you can be deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-status\">Legal status</h3>\n\n<p>The Mexican Police have the authority to ask for proof of legal status in Mexico at any time. Several British people have been detained for not having the relevant documentation on them. If you are a resident, you may be asked to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to bring electronic cigarettes, vaping devices and solutions into Mexico or to buy and sell them. If found in your belongings by customs officials, these will be confiscated; resulting in being fined or being detained.</p>\n\n<p>You can be fined up to \u00a3150 for smoking or vaping in public places.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe and convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relations in Mexico are generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Civil unions between same-sex partners are legal in Mexico.    Public displays of affection between same-sex couples may be frowned upon. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>Assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, is only legally recognised in some Mexican states. If you\u2019re considering a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico, familiarise yourself with the relevant laws and regulations and make sure you meet all legal requirements to take the child out of Mexico before you start the process. Seek independent legal advice before entering into any surrogacy arrangement. For more information <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">see our guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"main-tourist-destinations\">Main tourist destinations</h2>\n\n<p>The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Cancun</li>\n  <li>Cozumel</li>\n  <li>Los Cabos</li>\n  <li>Nuevo Vallarta</li>\n  <li>Playa del Carmen</li>\n  <li>Puerto Vallarta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British travellers have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. On occasion, hotel staff have not been helpful and tried to dissuade victims from pursuing the incident with police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cancun-and-tulum\">Cancun and Tulum</h3>\n\n<p>There have been several clashes between rival criminal gangs in popular tourist destinations in Cancun and surrounding areas.</p>\n\n<p>Two foreign tourists were killed in Tulum, more tourists were injured during a shoot out in Puerto Morelos, and most recently there was a shooting in a hotel in Playa del Carmen in locations popular with tourists. While tourists have not been the target, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected. Since 2021, there have been several cases of tourists being affected by shootings.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise increased caution after dark in downtown areas of Cancun, Tulum, and Playa del Carmen. Remain in well-lit pedestrian streets and tourist zones. If you are visiting any of these areas, monitor local advice, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hotel-safety\">Hotel safety</h2>\n\n<p>In some hotels, balcony balustrades may not be as high as you expect and there could be a risk of falling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>If you take part in adventurous sports (including paragliding, skydiving, scuba diving and jet-skiing), make sure safety precautions are in place. Equipment may not meet UK safety and insurance standards. British nationals have been injured and, in some cases, killed participating in extreme sports.</p>\n\n<p>You should make sure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you only use reputable operators</li>\n  <li>the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features</li>\n  <li>the company are fully licensed and insured</li>\n  <li>you\u2019re covered by your travel insurance for all the activities you want to undertake</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are rare in Mexico, but you should take care particularly when surfing, research the local area and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Crocodiles are present in Mexico, most commonly in lagoons and coastal areas. Sightings have been reported near tourist areas, including Cancun and resorts on the Pacific coast. There are signs warning about crocodiles around many lagoons in these areas. Respect the warnings and do not walk too close to the water. Tourists have been seriously injured in crocodile attacks in the past.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards are very different from the UK. Roads can be pot-holed, and driving conditions can be unpredictable. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lane without indicating and going through red lights. Many local drivers do not have any form of car insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Mexico using a UK license or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.

Cars may be banned from entering certain areas on particular days, based on their number plates, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/programas/programa/hoy-no-circula\">Check the Hoy no Circula</a> programme for further details.</p>\n\n<p>These regulations are strictly enforced and offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle. Check if this applies with your car hire company.</p>\n\n<p>There is an additional driving restriction in Mexico City, where vehicles without registration plates from the State of Mexico (\u2018Estado de Mexico\u2019) or Mexico City are not allowed to enter Mexico City from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Monday to Friday between 5am and 11am</li>\n  <li>Saturday between 5am and 10pm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If air pollution is high, generally between February and June, further driving restrictions may apply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>In remote areas, you may come across unofficial roadblocks, including on main roads. They are manned by local groups seeking money for an unofficial local toll, they can become violent and deny entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Passengers have been robbed and assaulted by unlicensed taxi drivers including in Mexico City. Use the better regulated \u2018sitio\u2019 taxis from authorised taxi ranks or ask your hotel to order you a taxi.

Armed clashes between security forces and drug groups can happen at any time without warning. Take extreme care outside tourist areas in all of these states.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"baja-california-including-tijuana\">Baja California (including Tijuana)</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tijuana in Baja California, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>airside transit through Tijuana airport</li>\n  <li>the cross border express taken from the airport zone</li>\n  <li>passage through Tijuana to cross the border via the federal toll road 1D and Via R\u00e1pida</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We also advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tecate including the roads 2D and 2 that connects Tijuana and Tecate.</p>\n\n<p>If you are crossing the border by toll road 1D try to do so during daylight, or be very cautious  after dark. Tijuana is an extremely violent city and there is a risk that you may be targeted or caught up in conflicts between rival groups.</p>\n\n<p>Many businesses including shops operate with an unofficial curfew, only opening during day light hours due to the security threat. There are several organised crime groups fighting for control over the city\u2019s drugs trade and trafficking routes.

There are frequent gun battles between government security forces and organised crime groups , including in the city of Culiac\u00e1n, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst tourists are not usually targeted, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or on suspicion of spying for other organised criminal gangs \u2013 particularly if you are off the beaten tourist track.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tamaulipas\">Tamaulipas</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Tamaulipas except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the border crossing at Nuevo Laredo accessed from Monterrey by federal toll road 85D. You should travel during daylight hours</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tamaulipas is dangerous due to the presence of many organised crime groups who fight for control of drug trafficking routes. There is a risk of armed robbery and kidnap.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2023, two foreign tourists were killed after a group were kidnapped at gunpoint in Matamoros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zacatecas\">Zacatecas</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Zacatecas.</p>\n\n<p>The state is extremely dangerous due to battles between organised crime groups for control of drug trafficking routes and rural areas of the state.</p>\n\n<p>There are high levels of drug-related violence, due to the strong presence of organised crime Gun battles between state security forces and organised crime groups are frequent, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"east\">East</h2>\n\n<p>There have been increased security incidents in the states of Tabasco and Veracruz, including the city of Veracruz. Illegal roadblocks have also been reported more frequently. You should take extreme care.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"south\">South</h2>\n\n<p>Criminal activity is a problem in the state of Chiapas. Take care when travelling through the state as well as outside of tourist areas. There are illegal roadblocks and checkpoints on the roads in this region. Some incidents of kidnapping have been reported. You should organise all activities with a reputable tour company or trusted local guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"west-and-central\">West and Central</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"colima\">Colima</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole state, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the city of Manzanillo reached by sea or by air via Manzanillo-Costalegre International Airport, and direct travel via road 200 from the airport to Manzanillo. Do not travel by other routes to the city of Manzanillo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Colima has high levels of organised crime activity. The criminal organisations fight each other for control over the state, this leads to armed gun battles on the streets of Colima City as well as throughout rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guanajuato\">Guanajuato</h3>\n\n<p>In the state of Guanajuato, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south west of the road 45D. This includes the cities of Celaya and Irapuato as well as the municipalities of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Abasolo</li>\n  <li>Ac\u00e1mbaro</li>\n  <li>Cuer\u00e1maro</li>\n  <li>Huan\u00edmaro</li>\n  <li>Irapuato</li>\n  <li>Jaral del Progreso</li>\n  <li>Manuel Doblado</li>\n  <li>Morole\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>P\u00e9njamo</li>\n  <li>Pueblo Nuevo</li>\n  <li>Purisima del Rinc\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>Romita</li>\n  <li>Salamanca</li>\n  <li>Salvatierra</li>\n  <li>San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>Santiago Maravat\u00edo</li>\n  <li>Silao de la Victoria</li>\n  <li>Uriangato</li>\n  <li>Valle de Santiago</li>\n  <li>Yuriria</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guanajuato is a drug trafficking route. There have been increased security incidents and drug-related violence in the state of Guanajuato. Fuel thefts from plants and pipelines also happen. Organised crime activity is rampant, particularly in the south of the state. Shootouts are of particular concern in the state of Guanajuato as they can happen in heavily transited places with bystanders frequently being caught in the crossfire.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guerrero-including-acapulco\">Guerrero (including Acapulco)</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all travel to the State of Guerrero except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the town of Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa accessed by air</li>\n  <li>the town of Taxco accessed by the 95D and 200D federal toll roads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guerrero is a violent state with a history of insecurity. There is an organised crime presence throughout the state, including in central Acapulco and Chilpancingo. There have been several instances of armed crime, including shootings and executions, both within and outside the tourist areas in Acapulco and other areas of the state.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, normal work by local authorities to reduce the risks to tourists in the touristic zone in Acapulco has stopped while authorities focus on recovery efforts. There are reports of an increase in crime, robbery and looting across the city, including in previously designated tourist areas. You should take extreme care if travelling to Acapulco.</p>\n\n<p>There are many illegal roadblocks where local crime groups take control of toll booths. If you come across these, you will need to have cash to pay the fee to pass through the booth. If you\u2019re driving in Guerrero, avoid travel after dark and use toll roads where possible, although you may still experience disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>The interior of the state is dangerous. The organised crime groups and local \u2018self-defence\u2019 organisations often have control. Foreigners\u2019 presence in rural Guerrero is likely to be  seen as suspicious by organised crime and local \u2018self-defence\u2019 groups, and the possibility of misunderstanding and resulting in violence is high. There have been cases of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in the state.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"jalisco\">Jalisco</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south and southwest of Lake Chapala to the border state of Colima. Specifically the municipalities of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Acatl\u00e1n de Ju\u00e1rez</li>\n  <li>Amacueca</li>\n  <li>Ameca</li>\n  <li>Atemajac de Brizuela</li>\n  <li>Atengo</li>\n  <li>Atenguillo</li>\n  <li>Atoyac</li>\n  <li>Autl\u00e1n de Navarro</li>\n  <li>Ayutla</li>\n  <li>Casimiro Castillo</li>\n  <li>Chiquilistl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Cocula</li>\n  <li>Cuautitl\u00e1n de Garc\u00eda Barrag\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Cuautla</li>\n  <li>Ejutla</li>\n  <li>El Grullo</li>\n  <li>El Lim\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>G\u00f3mez Farias</li>\n  <li>Guachinango</li>\n  <li>Juchitl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Mixtl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>San Gabriel</li>\n  <li>San Marcos</li>\n  <li>San Mart\u00edn Hidalgo</li>\n  <li>Sayula</li>\n  <li>Tapalpa</li>\n  <li>Techaluta de Montenegro</li>\n  <li>Tecolotl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Tenamaxtl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Teocuitatl\u00e1n de Corona</li>\n  <li>Tolim\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Tonaya</li>\n  <li>Tuxcacuesco</li>\n  <li>Tuxcueca</li>\n  <li>Uni\u00f3n de Tula</li>\n  <li>Villa Corona</li>\n  <li>Villa Purificaci\u00f3n</li>\n  <li>Zacoalco de Torres</li>\n  <li>Zapotitl\u00e1n de Vadill</li>\n  <li>Zapotl\u00e1n el Grande</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The northern municipalities of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bola\u00f1os</li>\n  <li>Chimaltit\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Colotl\u00e1n</li>\n  <li>Hostotipaquillo</li>\n  <li>Huej\u00facar</li>\n  <li>Huequilla el Alto</li>\n  <li>Mezquitic</li>\n  <li>San Martin de Bola\u00f1os</li>\n  <li>Santa Maria de los \u00c1ngeles</li>\n  <li>Totatiche</li>\n  <li>Villa Guerrero</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is due to inaccessibility for security forces, lack of state control, drugs cultivation  and the fact this area is territory disputed between different criminal groups leads to high levels of violent crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"michoacn\">Michoac\u00e1n</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO advises against all travel to the State of Michoac\u00e1n except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the city of Morelia accessed by federal toll roads 15D, 126 and 43; and the federal toll road 48D between the city of Morelia and the General Francisco Mujica airport</li>\n  <li>the town of P\u00e1tzcuaro accessed by federal toll roads 14D and 15 from Morelia, and boat trips out to islands on Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro</li>\n  <li>the federal toll road 15D that traverses the state</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Michoac\u00e1n is one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states with high levels of organised crime activity and it does not have a security presence. The rural terrain of much of the state makes it difficult for state security forces to respond to incidents.</p>\n\n<p>There are several illegal roadblocks and checkpoints on the roads in this region. These tend to be run by local crime groups attempting to control who is entering and leaving. The Michoac\u00e1n state government itself recommends foreign nationals to avoid this region.</p>\n\n<p>Outsiders travelling in these regions are likely to attract the attention of organised crime groups, who will treat them with suspicion and as possible informants for either other criminal groups or state security, outsiders may be harmed or killed if suspected of being an informant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"centre\">Centre</h2>\n\n<p>Criminal activity is a problem in the state of Mexico (\u2018Estado de M\u00e9xico\u2019). Take care when travelling through the state, as well as outside of tourist areas.
