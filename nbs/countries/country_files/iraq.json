Protests can, and sometimes do, escalate into violence. You should avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Iraq remains subject to regional tensions. A number of areas of Iraq remain subject to sporadic attack by artillery, drones and rockets. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/safety-and-security#political-and-security-situation\">Political and security situation</a></p>\n\n<p>A threat to Western interests remains, including to UK citizens. You should remain vigilant, have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place, keeping these under review, and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the security situation and the advice against all travel to all provinces of Iraq except the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and against all but essential travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, British nationals are reminded that consular support in all of Iraq is severely limited.\u00a0The security situation across Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq could deteriorate quickly and without warning. You should not assume that, in the event of a further deterioration in the security situation, assistance to leave Iraq, including from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, will be available.</p>\n\n<p>You may be eligible to obtain a visit visa on arrival in federal Iraq. Check visa requirements with the Iraqi Embassy in London, or the Iraqi Consulate in Manchester before you travel. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) you may apply for an e-visa online before arrival on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://visit.gov.krd\">the e-visa portal of the Kurdistan Region Government</a>. It is also possible to obtain a visa on arrival. Both types of visa are valid for travel in the KRI only. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/entry-requirements#Visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>The Iraqi Prime Minister announced the territorial defeat of Daesh in Iraq on 9 December 2017. However, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iraq. You should remain vigilant and monitor media reports. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country, including from both Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups, which can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. You should review your security arrangements regularly and consider carefully any travel plans around the country. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/terrorism/#kidnap\">Kidnap</a></p>\n\n<p>Since October 2023 drone and rocket attacks directed at US military installations have occurred across Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\u00a0Erbil International Airport has experienced temporary closures for brief periods with operations resuming after a few hours. Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and, occasionally, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, especially around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Iran has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks by ballistic rockets and drones, including in Erbil, Koya and surrounding areas. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.

Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the British Consulate-General in Erbil operate a limited consular service by appointment only. The Embassy and Consulate-General\u2019s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.</p>\n\n<p>As of 26 October, some UK Government staff have been temporarily withdrawn from the British Embassy Baghdad due to risks of a deterioration in the security situation. The Embassy will continue essential work, including consular support, which remains extremely limited in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>Take out comprehensive travel and medical <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-insurance\">insurance</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Before you travel, <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a> for Iraq\u2019s current entry restrictions and requirements.

A number of areas of Iraq remain subject to sporadic attack by artillery, drones and rockets. Since October 2023 drone and rocket attacks directed at US military installations have occurred across Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>As of 26 October, some UK Government staff have been temporarily withdrawn from the British Embassy Baghdad due to risks of a deterioration in the security situation. The Embassy will continue essential work, including consular support, which remains extremely limited in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>A threat to Western interests remains, including to UK citizens. You should remain vigilant, have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place, keeping these under review, and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>Protests regularly take place in and around the International Zone in Baghdad. Protests can escalate into violence. You should avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Large protests also occur regularly across Iraq. While many of these demonstrations are peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. You should avoid any rallies, marches and/or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the assistance that the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can provide.

Make sure that you are content with your own and your family\u2019s security arrangements and keep yourself up to date with developments, including by regularly monitoring this travel advice. Be prepared to \u201cshelter in place\u201d or hunker down for several days, should the security situation require it. This means having adequate essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. You should ensure you have correct and up-to-date travel documentation in case a sudden deterioration in the situation on the ground requires travel out of Iraq. Do not rely on the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> being able to evacuate you in an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. Curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly during protests and civil unrest, but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.</p>\n\n<p>British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling or moving to Iraq, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling. Outside of the Kurdistan Region you are strongly advised to employ a private security company, make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport and consider pre-deployment training.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-and-western-iraq\">Northern and western Iraq</h3>\n\n<p>Areas liberated from Daesh are likely to contain remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"baghdad\">Baghdad</h3>\n\n<p>Routes in and out of Baghdad may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice.

You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid political gatherings and large crowds, and minimise your movement around banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Observe instructions given by the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kurdistan-region-of-iraq\">Kurdistan Region of Iraq</h3>\n\n<p>While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Daesh.</p>\n\n<p>Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region and on occasion, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.</p>\n\n<p>Iran has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks by ballistic rockets and drones, including in Erbil, Koya and surrounding areas. There have also been a number of attacks in border areas.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2023, there have been a number of drone and rocket attacks on US military installations in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals crossing the border from neighbouring countries into the KRI have been arrested for immigration offences.

Maritime and sailing craft should take great care in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels transiting the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of attack. You should consider any regional tensions that may affect your route.</p>\n\n<p>Check whether sea borders will be open before your crossing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> to drive in Iraq. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted.

You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel within Iraq remains highly dangerous. Driving standards are low compared to those is the UK. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. False vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch terrorist attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h2>\n\n<p>UK Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The Baghdad Embassy and Erbil  Consulate-General\u2019s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you need urgent consular assistance, call the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"advice-to-business\">Advice to business</h2>\n\n<p>A number of UK companies visit and operate successfully in Iraq.

However, the risk of terrorist attacks in Iraq remains. Attacks are more frequent in areas where Daesh had a strong presence and capability, such as Anbar, Baghdad, Ninewah, Salah-Al-Din, Diyala and Tam\u2019mim (Kirkuk) provinces, but can occur throughout the entire country.</p>\n\n<p>While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Daesh.</p>\n\n<p>Targets for terrorist attacks have included: residential compounds, military establishments, oil facilities, airports, public transport, commercial venues, including markets and stores, maritime facilities, land border crossings, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, large crowds, police stations, political offices/events, sports venues/stadiums and religious sites/ceremonies. There is a heightened threat of attacks against western interests. While attacks can take place at any time, there\u2019s a heightened threat during religious or public holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.</p>\n\n<p>Other militant groups opposed to western presence in Iraq continue to pose a threat to UK and other interests in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals, including those of non-western appearance, are high value targets for terrorists, insurgents and criminals. Indiscriminate attacks against public places and Iraqi civilians also occur.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Iraq to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"aviation\">Aviation</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorists in Iraq likely maintain the intent and capability to target aviation.</p>\n\n<p>Targets for terrorist attacks have included Iraq\u2019s Airports.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2023 drone and rocket attacks directed at US military installations have occurred across Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Erbil International Airport has experienced temporary closures for brief periods with operations resuming after a few hours.</p>\n\n<p>Both Baghdad International Airport, and Erbil Airport have been targeted by indirect rocket attacks. The most recent attacks took place in September 2021 (Erbil) and January 2022 (Baghdad).</p>\n\n<p>You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports and observe any additional security measures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country, including from both Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups. You should review your security arrangements regularly and consider carefully any travel plans around the country. Kidnappings can be for purely ideological reasons as well as financial or political gain. British nationals have previously been targeted.</p>\n\n<p>You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country. Close protection security is important, but does not remove the threat; a number of previous kidnap victims had security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<p>The US Overseas Security Advisory Council has previously issued warnings over the risk of kidnapping attempts on the vehicles of non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff providing aid to Mosul and on the elevated kidnap risk to US citizens in Baghdad and wider Iraq, linked to the elevated tensions between the US and Iran.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>International and local journalists have previously been detained in Iraq due to allegations of inadequate paperwork. Journalists should exercise extreme caution and take adequate security measures.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.  Versions prior to 2 September 2020 will be archived as FCO travel advice.
