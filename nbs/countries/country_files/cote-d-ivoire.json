Fatal clashes between militias and the security forces have taken place in and around this area in the past. Seek professional local advice before embarking on any travel to these areas. Take care if you intend to travel to any rural areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Driving standards and road conditions in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are poor, although they are improving in Abidjan where the road infrastructure is being upgraded. There is a high rate of fatal road accidents, and emergency service provision outside Abidjan can be limited or absent. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be in bad mechanical condition. Red taxis, which can be hailed on the street tend to be for private use and yellow ones are shared. Caution is advised with shared taxis and try to avoid using them after dark. Online taxi booking services operate in Abidjan. Wear a seat belt at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks-and-checkpoints\">Roadblocks and checkpoints</h3>\n\n<p>You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan. You might also find official and unofficial roadblocks and checkpoints on the major routes outside of Abidjan. Take care and co-operate with those operating them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The European Commission has published a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">list of air carriers</a> that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the European Union.\u00a0You should check the list to see whether this will affect your travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor changes to travel restrictions and make sure that you have adequate and flexible travel arrangements in place for your onward journey from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n\n<p>Ocean currents are very strong along the coast, and rip tides cause many swimming accidents.

A terrorist attack took place at Grand Bassam near Abidjan on 13 March 2016, in which 18 people were killed including a number of foreigners. The attack was claimed by Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M). Further attacks on beach resorts, hotels, caf\u00e9s and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning.
