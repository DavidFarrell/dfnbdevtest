Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Our ability to offer consular support within this region is extremely limited, and in the event of military action on/near the border with Ukraine, would be further reduced. From 28 February, all checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region have temporarily closed. All other border crossings into Moldova remain open. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>On 7 June, the Transnistrian de facto parliament gave greater powers for prosecutions and pre-trial detentions against those regarded as \u201cextremists\u201d. The de facto authorities interpret \u201cextremism\u201d in a way that includes many activities that British nationals would consider legitimate, including moderate protest or freedom of expression.

We will update this Travel Advice when that changes.</p>\n\n<p>Since autumn 2022 there have been regular political demonstrations in central Chisinau, and occasionally elsewhere. These are likely to continue. They have been small in scale, and generally peaceful and well-policed. Since February 2023, there have been reports and evidence of organised attempts by certain groups to use such demonstrations as a cover for causing disturbances. You are advised to stay away from all political demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against those who overstay. See <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant to petty crime, particularly in Chisinau. Leave your passport, travel documents and other valuable items in a safe place, and carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>There are strong penalties for possession or use of drugs.
