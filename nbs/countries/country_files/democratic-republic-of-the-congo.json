There are continued reports of several towns in eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> being attacked by or falling under temporary control of armed groups, including some territories and villages within a 30km range north of Goma. Armed groups are present and intercommunal violence can affect the political, security and humanitarian situation. You should be prepared to leave at short notice via available routes. Travellers should regularly check government advice for updates.</p>\n\n<p>Since November 2021 the armed group M23 have launched a series of military offensives in North Kivu province capturing the town of Kibumba (approximately 15km north of Goma) in November 2022. Advances towards Goma could occur with little warning and existing routes out of Goma, including the airport and border, could close at short notice. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0staff may leave the area temporarily at short notice. You should be prepared to leave at short notice via available routes. Travellers should regularly check UK Government advice for updates.</p>\n\n<p>The situation in Goma remains uncertain, in November 2022 armed groups were reported to have advanced within 15km of the city. Local authorities are on a heightened state of alert, there is an increased presence of <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> military, UN peacekeepers and regional forces in the city, UK nationals should remain vigilant. We advise all citizens to consider alternative means of transport when exiting the city.</p>\n\n<p>A \u201cstate of siege\u201d is in place in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu. Military administrations have replaced the civilian administrations during this period. The military administrations have extended security powers. You should be vigilant about the situation.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, Tanganyika or within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice you should be vigilant at all times and keep your security situation under constant review.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of attacks and kidnappings, including against staff from NGOs and international organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Troops from <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> and other African countries are currently present in eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. This is in addition to the UN MONUSCO peacekeeping force.</p>\n\n<p>You should be especially vigilant, consider travelling in convoy on trips outside Goma and Bukavu and avoid making any journeys that would involve travel after dark. Tourists in eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high.</p>\n\n<p>While British government staff do visit areas of eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>, they are not always in the area, and as with anywhere outside of Kinshasa the British Embassy\u2019s ability to offer consular assistance is severely limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There is a small but increasing threat of criminal \u201cexpress\u201d kidnap in <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. There have been incidents (February, March and April 2023) of foreigners being targeted by individuals impersonating police in the Limete area of Kinshasa. Kidnaps are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners can be perceived as being wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk of kidnap for financial gain.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the risk of street crime and armed robbery at all times. Foreigners are at particular risk of street robbery in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, especially near hotels and supermarkets in the centre of town. Robberies by gangs of street children are increasingly common and can be aggressive.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies by people posing as taxi drivers or taxi customers are common in Kinshasa, and are often accompanied by a threat of violence. You should avoid using any taxis in <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don\u2019t hail taxis on the street.</p>\n\n<p>Car jackings are rare but can occur.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of an increase in criminal activity in North and South Kivu specifically targeting the international community. There have been many reports of robberies and banditry in Goma especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t walk in the streets alone at any time, especially at night. Avoid displaying valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible and keep copies of documents, including your passport separately.</p>\n\n<p>Some gangs use girls to lure people into traps; others promise cut-price gold and diamonds, or pose as police or security forces.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a risk of arbitrary arrests of foreigners by security authorities who demand payment for release.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inter-communal-violence\">Inter-communal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Inter-communal violence between ethnic groups over land in Kwamouth territory of Mai-Ndombe province has been ongoing since August 2022. There have been a high number of casualties (300+) including women and children. The government has responded with a military deployment to the area. We are not aware of any direct threat against the international community or British Nationals, but visitors should be aware of the increased violence and potential threat to all those not of the groups\u2019 ethnicity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local Travel</h3>\n\n<p>The border crossings between Rwanda and the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are liable to short notice closure.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re crossing regularly between Rwanda and <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> you may encounter immigration difficulties if you haven\u2019t regularised your residency status.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>\u2019s borders with all of its neighbours can be subject to closure at short notice, you should check travel advice for: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</p>\n\n<p>You should be prepared to move at short notice or lock down for a period of time. The local authorities may impose curfews without warning. You should follow the advice of the local authorities at all times. In the event of escalating tensions and civil unrest, commercial flights may be suspended and borders closed. Keep your travel documents up to date so you can avoid facing difficulties should you need to leave in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You will need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> (IDP) to drive in the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Car hire is possible in Kinshasa although self-drive options are limited. Most car hire companies will only rent a car with a driver. Public transport such as taxis are often not well maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions and standards are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Traffic accidents are common. Roads in Kinshasa are poorly maintained. Outside Kinshasa and other main cities, most roads are barely drivable even with a 4x4, especially during the rainy season (September to May). Consider the technical capability of your vehicle and be confident in your ability to safely operate it. Outside Kinshasa and the main cities, travel after dark brings increased risk.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of vehicle theft and car-jacking. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving and watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Don\u2019t drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.</p>\n\n<p>Security forces operate roadblocks, particularly after dark. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a check point, remain in your vehicle and show them through closed windows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>The railways are in a dilapidated state and you should be aware of the increased risk of  travel by train. In late 2015 a refurbished route opened between Kinshasa and Matadi, although services are infrequent and unreliable.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr> that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.

As a result of the low safety standards, high river traffic levels, strong currents, shifting sandbanks and poor maintenance there have been many accidents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Political gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent in <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. Presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections are scheduled for 20 December 2023 and could lead to heightened tensions.</p>\n\n<p>A United Nations peacekeeping presence is deployed in eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. The Congolese army is carrying out operations against foreign and domestic armed groups operating in North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces. Foreign, regional forces are also present in eastern <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\">DRC</abbr>. Large numbers of civilians remain displaced as a result of the conflict.

This has resulted in large numbers of children adopted by foreign nationals unable to leave the country, or their departure being delayed by more than 30 months. In May 2017 the DRC Senate adopted a law banning homosexual and trans-sexual couples from adopting Congolese children.

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or brought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>.

The outbreak began on 21 August 2022 in Beni, North Kivu province in Eastern DRC. There have been no new cases since the 21 August 2022. Further information and updates on Ebola can be <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo\">found on the NaTHNaC website</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h3>\n\n<p>There are outbreaks of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/56/cholera\">cholera</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/18/yellow-fever\">yellow fever</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/116/measles\">measles</a> in DRC. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo#Malaria\">Malaria</a> is also common in DRC. If you\u2019re travelling within DRC, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo\">follow health advice from NaTHNaC</a>.  You should get vaccinated against yellow fever before entering DRC. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo#Vaccine_recommendations\">Check the NaTHNaC website</a> for more information on vaccine recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2012 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated that around 390,000 adults aged 15 or over were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 1.1 of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>Plague is endemic in North eastern Province Ituri. The 9th outbreak of plague was announced in Ituri province on 4 April 2022.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n\n<p>If you become ill during or immediately after travelling to the country, seek medical advice immediately. Medical care is extremely limited. The Centre Prive d\u2019Urgence (CPU) clinic in Kinshasa is able to cope with basic health problems and to stabilise a patient after most serious accidents. Outside Kinshasa, western standard medical facilities are almost non-existent. Medical evacuation to South Africa (or elsewhere) is often necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. If you take medication regularly, bring in a properly-marked supply, sufficient for the time you will be in the DRC, with you.</p>\n",
