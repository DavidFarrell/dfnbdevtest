There are occasional violent crimes including armed robbery and sexual assault.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure your accommodation is secure \u2013 this also applies if you\u2019re staying on a yacht\u00a0</li>\n  <li>take care when walking alone off main roads and at late night street parties, particularly during the festival season\u00a0</li>\n  <li>avoid isolated areas, including beaches, after dark\u00a0</li>\n  <li>only use licensed taxis\u00a0</li>\n  <li>do not carry large amounts of cash or jewellery\u00a0</li>\n  <li>keep valuables and travel documents in your hotel safe or a safety deposit box\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"laws-on-clothing\">Laws on clothing\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for all drug offences. Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry anything through customs for anyone else.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Local attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. Certain same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Grenada. Showing affection in public may attract unwanted and negative attention. It is uncommon for opposite or same-sex couples to show affection in public in Grenada.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Currents can be deceptively strong and not all beaches have lifeguards or warning flags.

You must have a temporary Grenadian driving licence. Your car hire company will help you get one, and you\u2019ll need to show a UK driving licence.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Roads can have potholes and speed bumps. Minor roads and roads in rural areas are often narrow and may have blind corners. Drivers do not always use indicators. Pedestrians often walk on the roads.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some roads are unlit at night. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Do not stop if you\u2019re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving. If you have an accident, call the police and do not move the vehicle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-minibuses\">Taxis and minibuses\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis are not metered. There are standard taxi fares for most destinations. To avoid being overcharged, agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as East Caribbean dollars.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you use private taxis, you can ask the driver to observe speed limits, but minibus drivers often exceed them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u202f\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November.

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uwiseismic.com/volcanoes/kick-em-jenny/kej-monitoring/\">alert level of the underwater volcano \u2018Kick \u2018em Jenny\u2019</a>, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada.
