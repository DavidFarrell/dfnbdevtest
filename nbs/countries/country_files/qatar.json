Sentences can be severe. However, Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual.  If they are determined to have been consensual, the victim or attacker may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been sexually assaulted, contact the British Embassy for advice (00 974 4496 2000).

The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Qatar in 2024 will  likely start on 10 March and will last for 30 days. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes  \u2013 clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Only licensed hotels, restaurants and bars can sell alcohol.

The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. Places serving alcohol will ask for original photo IDs (copies are not accepted) upon entry.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. For example, if you drink in a non-licenced public place, you could get a prison sentence of up to 6 months or a fine up to 3,000 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-outside-marriage\">Relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Any intimacy in public, between any couples (including between teenagers), can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Living together while unmarried is illegal in Qatar. Sex outside marriage is illegal for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. You can be arrested and punishments can include a fine, a custodial sentence and deportation once the sentence is complete.</p>\n\n<p>Because of laws on sex outside marriage, if someone becomes pregnant outside marriage, both partners could face imprisonment or deportation. Doctors will ask for proof of marriage during antenatal checks.</p>\n\n<p>An unmarried woman who gives birth in Qatar may also face problems registering the birth of the child in Qatar, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the Qatari authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate. Authorities may compare the marriage date against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Qatar. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Organisers of protests need to get permission from the Ministry of Interior. This must be done in advance and cannot be spontaneous.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swearing-and-rude-gestures\">Swearing and rude gestures</h3>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts. You can be jailed or deported. Take particular care when dealing with police and other officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is prohibited in all closed public spaces including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, public transport, malls, restaurants and government buildings.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to vape/use an e-cigarette or import vapes into the country. You can be arrested and punishments can include a fine, a custodial sentence or deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences in Qatar, including some medications which are legal in other countries, but illegal in Qatar. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/qatar/health#bringing-medication-into-qatar\">bringing medication into Qatar</a></p>\n\n<p>Penalties for using, trafficking, smuggling and possessing drugs (even residual amounts) are severe. Punishment can include lengthy custodial sentences, heavy fines and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when filming or photographing people as taking pictures of people without their consent can cause offense.</p>\n\n<p>Some visitors attempting to film or photograph near religious, military, government or construction sites have been arrested. If in doubt, seek permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalistic-activity\">Journalistic activity</h3>\n\n<p>Journalists must get permission from the Qatar News Agency (QNA) to film or photograph as part of their work and enter the country on a visiting press permit. This permit allows you to take technical equipment like cameras through airport customs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"social-media\">Social media</h3>\n\n<p>There are strict privacy laws in Qatar. Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that appear to insult, slander or are culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime. Individuals have been detained, prosecuted and convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crimes\">Financial crimes</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fraud</li>\n  <li>giving somebody a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and \u2018security\u2019 cheques)</li>\n  <li>non-payment of bills (for example hotel bills or car hire)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also be liable for cheques that you have signed on behalf of a company.</p>\n\n<p>Financial crimes can be punished with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>imprisonment</li>\n  <li>fines</li>\n  <li>deportation</li>\n  <li>freezing bank accounts and other assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have unpaid loans or financial commitments you won\u2019t be able to cancel your residence permit, and may be prevented from leaving Qatar, including to go on holiday. All debts should be settled in full before you leave the country. Ask your bank for a certificate to confirm you have no outstanding debt once you have cleared the balance.</p>\n\n<p>If you have sponsorship, it may be blocked, which will prevent you from transferring to a new sponsor (employer). Any end of service benefits you may be entitled to could be used to offset the outstanding debt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deportation\">Deportation</h3>\n\n<p>If you are found guilty of an offence, you may be deported. This can happen whether or not the judgement included deportation. This may affect your ability to return to Qatar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Get a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> if you plan to drive on your UK licence. You can get IDPs over the counter from many UK post offices. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Qatar with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months with a valid IDP.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-in-qatar\">Driving in Qatar</h3>\n\n<p>The driver and front seat passenger must wear a seat belt at all times. It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving, and you could be fined 500 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<p>Flashing your lights in Qatar can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a custodial sentence of between one month and 3 years, a fine of 10,000 to 50,000 Qatari riyals, or both. Offenders may also be deported.</p>\n\n<p>Even minor expressions of \u2018road rage\u2019 like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. You may be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fined</li>\n  <li>imprisoned</li>\n  <li>deported</li>\n  <li>banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved \u2013 serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://portal.moi.gov.qa/metrash2/en/index.html\">Metrash2 app</a> before trying to leave the country, which lists any outstanding traffic violations. If you have an outstanding violation, you could be detained at immigration and denied onward travel. Fines for all violations should be settled in full before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n\n<p>Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and accidents are common. If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle until the police arrive and tell you that you can leave. It\u2019s illegal to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it\u2019s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You\u2019ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly-equipped 4x4 vehicle. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in convoy with other cars</li>\n  <li>take a supply of water and a mobile telephone</li>\n  <li>leave travel plans with friends or relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"transport-safety\">Transport safety</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport. If using apps, check licence plates and confirm with drivers the passenger name. Let someone know you are on the way home and the registration details of the car.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n",
