Some cities, including Almaty, saw violent clashes between protestors and police with deaths, injuries and arrests reported. The situation is now calm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Most visits are trouble-free. However, mugging and theft occur in cities and rural areas. Foreigners can be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent attacks and muggings on the expatriate community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan, and in Astana and Almaty. Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view. Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies have occurred on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger lists on aircraft are not always kept confidential.

You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are a single Customs Union so if you\u2019re planning to travel overland in your own vehicle make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for the entire period of stay in all three countries. Your import licence can be extended for up to a year if necessary by contacting the customs authorities in any of the three countries.</p>\n\n<p>Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Make sure you take all you need for your journey including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in good condition for lengthy journeys.</p>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly maintained and road works or damaged roads are often not clearly signposted. Driving standards can be erratic. In some remote areas there are often stray animals on the roads. These are especially difficult to see in the dark. In winter, roads can become hazardous due to snow and ice.</p>\n\n<p>Local traffic police only have the right to stop vehicles if an offence has been committed, but you should obey any request from the police to stop. The police officer should complete official papers relating to any alleged offence.</p>\n\n<p>Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when crossing roads as pedestrian crossings are rarely respected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>You are advised to check the UK Air Safety List when flying with foreign air carriers. \u00a0The Civil Aviation Authority <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Air Safety List (ASL)</a> identifies foreign airlines which do not meet international safety standards. These airlines are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>use the list to inform your decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>consult local travel providers to find alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kazakhstan.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government advises its employees in Kazakhstan against using Petropavlovsk airport due to safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p>On 27 December 2019, an internal flight operated by the carrier \u2018Bek Air\u2019 crashed in Almaty, killing a number of people. Kazakhstan\u2019s civil aviation authority has suspended the company\u2019s licence. A list of further incidents and accidents in Kazakhstan can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=UN\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Local airlines do not always run to flight schedule. Check your actual departure or arrival time in advance. Keep hold of your baggage tags, as you will need to show them when you leave the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised in advance. Unauthorised small-scale public protests do take place occasionally, in contravention of local law, putting participants at risk of arrest.

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare\">Healthcare</h2>\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance, although the emergency services operators only speak Kazakh or Russian and waiting times for ambulances can be lengthy. If possible it is often quicker to take a taxi to the hospital. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Kazakhstan.</p>\n\n<p>The medical facilities in Kazakhstan are not as advanced as those in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>It is not common for medical personnel in Kazakhstan to speak English. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kazakhstan-list-of-medical-facilities/list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners-in-kazakhstan--2\">View guidance on medical facilities in Kazakhstan</a> for a list of English-speaking doctors.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies and chemists are widely available in Kazakhstan and some remain open 24/7. They are often marked by a red or green cross.</p>\n\n<p>Basic medications (aspirin etc.) are available without a prescription. For prescription medication you will need to present a valid prescription either from a local doctor or your doctor in the UK. Pharmacies will often accept prescriptions from the UK. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Kazakh. Make sure you have adequate medication to cover your trip.</p>\n\n<p>Some prescription medicines used in the UK are not widely available in Kazakhstan. Your local doctor or pharmacy is best placed to advise on availability of specific medications. Medications are often supplied under different brand names in Kazakhstan so it is important to ask for the generic name of the relevant drug. If your prescription medication is not available locally, it may be possible to get supplies couriered from abroad through some private clinics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>There are regular outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever (a tick-borne disease) in southern Kazakhstan in spring and summer, which have caused deaths.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of lead pollution in the southern city of Shymkent and immediately surrounding areas.</p>\n",
