The vast majority of visits are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport including the \u2018Careem\u2019 and \u2018Uber\u2019 apps. In Dubai authorised taxis are painted cream with different coloured roofs \u2013 taxis with pink roofs have female drivers. In Abu Dhabi taxis are painted silver/grey.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. The UAE imposes life imprisonment for males who rape a female and the death penalty can be applied in certain cases.  However, UAE law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, either party may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside marriage in certain circumstances. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates/local-laws-and-customs\">Local Laws and customs</a> page</p>\n\n<p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, and should use a reputable taxi company, particularly at night. Drink spiking can occur. Don\u2019t accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beach-safety\">Beach safety</h2>\n\n<p>Rip currents can occur at any beach, and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting the UAE, you can drive a rental car using your UK driving licence. If you intend to drive a private vehicle as a visitor, you should check that you\u2019re covered under the vehicle\u2019s insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re applying for residence in the UAE, you can use your UK licence until your residence permit is issued, after which you\u2019ll need to immediately get a UAE driving licence from the traffic department.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards in the UAE are not always as disciplined as in the UK and there is a high rate of traffic accidents. Speeding is common.</p>\n\n<p>It is a criminal offence in the UAE to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount. Your insurance is also likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident. Offensive gestures and bad language directed at other drivers can lead to fines, a jail sentence, and possibly deportation. Flashing your lights in the UAE can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident you should follow the rules of the Emirate in which you are travelling. In Abu Dhabi, if no one has been hurt and vehicle damage is minor, drivers should move vehicles to the side of the road to avoid blocking traffic; otherwise, the vehicles should not be moved. In Dubai, you should only move your vehicle if it is causing an obstruction to other motorists. In the other Emirates, you may only move your car if the accident is minor and both parties agree who is responsible. In all cases, call the police. It is an offence to leave the scene of an accident before the police have arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be dangerous unless you\u2019re in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave a copy of your travel plans with friends or relatives.</p>\n\n<p>Pedestrians should take great care. Only cross roads using designated pedestrian crossings, failure to comply can lead to prosecution. Vehicles often don\u2019t stop at zebra crossings marked on the roads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. Mariners should make careful enquiries before entering these waters.</p>\n\n<p>You should consider how regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful when travelling by tourist boat. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Events in the Middle East can affect local public opinion. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which might trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2018, numerous missiles have been launched into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, including attacks on aviation interests. Most have been intercepted and destroyed but there have been a small number of casualties. Claims have been made in public media suggesting that there may also be attempts to target missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones) aimed at the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>A number of missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones) were launched into the UAE from Yemen in early 2022, targeting infrastructure and high profile locations, some of which were in populated areas.

The penalties for trafficking, smuggling and the possession of drugs (including residual amounts) are severe. Sentences for drug trafficking can include the death penalty. Possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum three-month prison term or a fine of between AED 20,000 and AED100,000. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession. Some herbal highs, like Spice, are illegal in the UAE. Possessing and concealing money from drugs related offences, and performing transactions using money from drug-related offences are also crimes, which could lead to imprisonment and a fine.</p>\n\n<p>Many people stop off in UAE airports on their way to other destinations. UAE airports have excellent technology and security, so transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in the UAE such as CBD oil. If found in possession of such products, they will be confiscated and you may face criminal charges.

Liquor licences are still required for Residents in Dubai but are no longer required for Residents in Abu Dhabi and other Emirates (save for Emirate of Sharjah) to purchase alcohol for personal consumption.</p>\n\n<p>In Dubai, tourists are able to obtain a temporary liquor licence for the duration of a month from the two official liquor distributors in Dubai. Tourists will be provided with a code of conduct document and will be asked to confirm they understand rules and regulations in relation to purchasing, transporting and consuming liquor in Dubai. This licence is only for use in the Emirate where it is issued.</p>\n\n<p>Liquor licences are not available to non-residents in the other Emirates, but it is possible for tourists and visitors to buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. However, you should be aware that it is a punishable offence under UAE law to drink or be under the influence of alcohol in public. British nationals have been arrested and charged under this law, often in cases where they have come to the attention of the police for a related offence, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the legal age for drinking alcohol is 18 in Abu Dhabi, but a Ministry of Tourism by-law prevents hotels from serving alcohol to those under the age of 21. In Dubai and all other emirates besides Sharjah, the drinking age is 21. Drinking alcohol in Sharjah is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Women should dress modestly when in public areas like shopping malls.

Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.</p>\n\n<p>Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-relationships-outside-marriage\">Sexual relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>If you become pregnant and give birth to a child in the UAE outside marriage, to obtain a local birth certificate both you and your partner will need to ensure that you either get married or you and/or your partner must singly or jointly acknowledge the child and provide identification papers and travel documents in accordance with the laws of your country considering the applicable laws of that nation. If you become pregnant outside of marriage, you may not be covered by your medical insurance, and you should consult with your medical insurance provider before giving birth in the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Consensual sexual relationships between a male and female outside marriage where both are over the age of 18 years, including extra-marital sexual relationships, is generally permitted under UAE law.  However, in the case of an extra-marital consensual sexual relationship, if either person\u2019s spouse or parent/guardian files a criminal complaint, then both parties of an extra-marital consensual relationship shall be liable to a jail sentence for a period not less than six months.</p>\n\n<p>If either person in a sexual relationship is under the age of 18 years, he/she is deemed a minor, and the other person over the age of 18 will be prosecuted for having a sexual relationship with a minor. If both people are under 18 years of age they will both be prosecuted but punishment is likely to be limited to a caution, parental supervision, judicial supervision, professional training or psychiatric treatment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"same-sex-relationships\">Same-sex relationships</h3>\n\n<p>All homosexual sex is illegal and same-sex marriages are not recognised.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is in many respects a tolerant society and private life is respected, although there have been some reports of individuals being punished for homosexual activity, particularly where there is any public element, or the behaviour has caused offence. This applies both to expatriate residents and to tourists.

Don\u2019t photograph people without their permission. Men have been arrested for photographing women on beaches. Hobbies like bird watching and plane spotting, may be misunderstood - particularly near military sites, government buildings and airports.</p>\n\n<p>Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that is critical of the UAE government, companies or individuals, or related to incidents in the UAE, or appearing to abuse/ridicule/criticise the country or its authorities, or that is culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime punishable under UAE law. There have been cases of individuals being detained, prosecuted and/or convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to carry out media activity related to the production, transmission and/or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video and/or visual information, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permission from the Emirati authorities in advance.

While this is not an unusual practice, it is illegal under UAE labour law.</p>\n\n<p>You should cancel your work visa before leaving the UAE permanently. If you don\u2019t do this, you risk being reported for leaving the UAE without permission and could be arrested if you return to the UAE, even if you are in transit to another country. Failure to repay debts or resolve any outstanding cases against you may also result in your arrest on return or transit through the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any doubt about your status before returning to the UAE seek advice from a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-lawyers\">local lawyer</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medication\">Medication</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel with any prescribed or over the counter medicines for personal use, you\u2019ll need to meet the UAE\u2019s specific requirements for your medicine to be allowed into the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering the country with medication that the UAE classes as narcotic, psychotropic, controlled or semi-controlled, approval is needed from the UAE authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Approval should be requested in advance.

The UAE authorities advise that applications are normally processed within 5 working days.</p>\n\n<p>If you arrive in the UAE without prior approval or the required documentation, the medication will not be allowed into the UAE and you may be prosecuted under UAE law. If you need more information on controlled medicines or the process for obtaining permission, you should contact the UAE Ministry of Health by emailing <a href=\"mailto:info@moh.gov.ae\">info@moh.gov.ae</a> or calling +971 800 11111.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling in transit through a UAE airport and do not intend entering the UAE, or are entering the UAE with other types of medicine, you\u2019re not required to go through this approval process.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, there are limits on the amount of medication that can be brought into the UAE legally. The Ministry of Health advise that you can bring up to 3 months\u2019 supply of medication as a visitor, reduced to one month\u2019s supply if the medication is included in the list requiring approval.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-israel\">Previous travel to Israel</h3>\n\n<p>UAE immigration authorities have advised that British nationals with valid or expired Israeli visas or stamps in their passports should not face any difficulties entering the UAE as long as they don\u2019t intend to work. If you do intend to work, further checks may be required and there is a risk that entry may be refused.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British-Israeli dual national and have any concerns about entering the UAE, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sp.mofaic.gov.ae/EN/DiplomaticMissions/Embassies/London/Pages/home.aspx\">Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in London</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regular-exit-requirements\">Regular exit requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors must have legal status in the UAE when they depart.
