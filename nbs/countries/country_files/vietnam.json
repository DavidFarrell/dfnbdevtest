These may be scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines-and-unexploded-weapons\">Landmines and unexploded weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard in former battlefields. Areas of particular risk include central Vietnam and along the Laos border, formerly crossed by the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to always carry photographic ID. You should carry a photocopy of the photo page of your passport with your personal details and visa and leave the original in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for possessing, distributing or manufacturing drugs are severe. You can get a death sentence if you\u2019re found with even small amounts.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal drugs are often tampered with or spiked and can be much stronger than in Europe. British nationals in Vietnam have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Vietnam is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are no criminal penalties for same-sex relationships and changing gender. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by law.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Respect local customs and dress in appropriate clothing when entering religious or cultural sites. This usually means covering your shoulders and knees. Signs informing you of the dress code outside religious or cultural sites are common.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money-change-counters\">Money change counters</h3>\n\n<p>Only change money at official money exchange counters with a clear sign showing this status. Changing money elsewhere is illegal and you risk losing your money.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rice-wine\">Rice wine</h3>\n\n<p>Some rice wines sold without recognised brand names can have very high and sometimes fatal levels of methanol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or collect protected wild animal or plants. If you\u2019re caught buying or trafficking these items, you could get a fine or long prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"restricted-areas\">Restricted areas</h3>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on travel near military bases.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to visit a village, commune or ward close to the border, you may need permission from the provincial police department. Contact the local authority for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-near-military-bases\">Using cameras near military bases</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photos near military bases in Vietnam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-system\">Legal system</h3>\n\n<p>Crimes like sex and drug offences can attract very long prison terms or a death sentence. The Vietnamese legal system is not well developed, and the standard of prisons is very poor.</p>\n\n<p>Reporting a crime to the police can be a long and difficult process. Consider taking a Vietnamese-speaking person with you to assist with the translation. You\u2019ll usually have to sign documents in Vietnamese. Take care to only sign accurately translated documents. Find an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/translators-interpreters?country=Vietnam\">English-speaking translator or interpreter in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are under criminal investigation, you can be detained for long periods without evidence. There can be long delays before you can contact lawyers, British consular officials or family. Legal representation is far below UK standards.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals involved in traffic accidents have been stopped from leaving Vietnam until the police have completed their investigations. This process can take a long time, and foreign nationals have been asked to agree out of court financial settlements. FCDO advises you to get professional legal advice and representation if you are in this situation. Find an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/lawyers?country=Vietnam\">English-speaking lawyer in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"internet-access\">Internet access</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes restrictions on internet use, which can temporarily affect access to social media websites. Most social media sites are normally available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals have died or been injured in Vietnam while engaged in adventure tourism in rural and mountainous areas.</p>\n\n<p>Risks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>dangerous terrain</li>\n  <li>remote areas that are difficult for rescue services to reach</li>\n  <li>flooding, swollen rivers and landslides, especially during the rainy season</li>\n  <li>lower safety standards than in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>follow safety guidelines</li>\n  <li>stay on main routes</li>\n  <li>take a reputable guide \u2013 in some places it is illegal to go without a guide</li>\n  <li>use approved adventure tourism companies - check local authority websites</li>\n  <li>check weather forecasts</li>\n  <li>make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Illegal tour guides have been known to offer tours and activities prohibited under local regulations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"firearms-activities\">Firearms activities</h3>\n\n<p>If you take part in leisure activities involving firearms, make sure a reputable guide supervises you. There is a risk of hearing loss.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Vietnam, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldriversassociation.com/vietnam-driving-guide/\">driving rules in Vietnam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car.</p>\n\n<p>Compliance with road laws is poor \u2013 keep your speed down and stay alert.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive without third-party insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Vietnam. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Do not use your passport as a deposit for hiring vehicles or as a guarantee you will pay a fine for a traffic offence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident or subject to an investigation, you could face criminal charges and may need to pay compensation to injured people, even if the injuries are minor. Offer the police your full co-operation and inform the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-hanoi\">British Embassy in Hanoi</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-ho-chi-minh-city\">Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorbike-safety\">Motorbike safety</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by motorbike in Vietnam is much riskier than in the UK. Motorbike accidents are common and have killed and injured British nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Do not drive a motorbike if you\u2019re not an experienced rider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive a motorbike, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check your motorbike thoroughly</li>\n  <li>rent from a reputable organisation</li>\n  <li>use a good helmet \u2013 it is illegal for drivers and passengers to ride without a helmet</li>\n  <li>know the roads on which you plan to travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Metered taxis from larger firms are generally reliable. There are many taxi operators and meters are set at different prices. The meter should start at around 8,000 to 20,000 Vietnamese dong, depending on the size of the taxi and the taxi company.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible get hotels or restaurants to book you a reputable taxi. Always make sure the driver identifies themself before setting off. If you book a taxi online or through an app, make sure the details of the vehicle and driver match those given by the company.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of overcharging for taxi journeys in tourist areas like the Old Quarter of Hanoi, Hanoi airport and Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s airport. For added peace of mind, book taxis using the Grab app, which is similar to Uber.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coaches\">Buses and coaches</h3>\n\n<p>Bus and coach crashes are not uncommon and more likely at night. Vehicles are often poorly maintained. Night bus drivers may become tired but continue driving, resulting in sometimes fatal crashes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Safety regulations and standards vary and are not the same as in the UK. Check with your tour guide about the safety record and registration of boats, and the certification of staff. Make sure you get a full safety briefing and have a life jacket when joining any boat.</p>\n\n<p>Consider safety standards carefully before taking an overnight boat trip on Halong Bay. Some boats have sunk quickly and without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in coastal areas of Vietnam is very rare. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">piracy and armed robbery at sea</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"tropical-cyclones\">Tropical cyclones</h3>\n\n<p>Tropical cyclones affect the eastern coastal regions of Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>Risks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>strong winds</li>\n  <li>heavy rainfall</li>\n  <li>flooding</li>\n  <li>disruption to transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The season normally runs from May to November, but tropical cyclones can happen at other times. Monitor approaching storms on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nchmf.gov.vn/KttvsiteE/en-US/2/index.html\">National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html#5/34.5/137/&amp;elem=root&amp;typhoon=all&amp;contents=typhoon&amp;lang=en\">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> websites. Follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Vietnam has a tropical monsoon climate. There can be large amounts of rain in short periods of time. Localised flooding, flash floods and landslides are common. Take care if you are trekking in rural and mountainous areas.</p>\n",
