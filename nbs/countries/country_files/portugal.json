Border guards use passport stamps to check you\u2019re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, a border officer will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<p>You can show evidence (boarding passes and tickets) of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area and ask border guards to add this date and location in your passport.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Portugal, your passport should not be stamped. You should show your proof of residence and passport at border control.

Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (for example to work or study or for business travel), you must meet the Portuguese government\u2019s entry requirements.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u202fterrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-portugal\">Terrorism in Portugal</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Portugal cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Crime rates are low but pickpocketing, handbag snatching, and theft from holiday properties are common in major tourist areas. Foreign-registered and hire cars are often targeted by thieves. Thieves can use violence, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep sight of your belongings at all times</li>\n  <li>beware of thieves using distraction techniques</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying all your valuables together in handbags or pockets</li>\n  <li>leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place</li>\n  <li>avoid leaving items in an unattended car</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing is a risk. Take care on public transport and at busy stations and crowded bus and tram stops.  Be particularly vigilant on the number 15 and 28 trams in Lisbon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-theft\">Passport theft</h3>\n\n<p>Report the loss or theft of your passport immediately to the local police and get a police report. You will need the report for insurance claims.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"holiday-accommodation\">Holiday accommodation</h3>\n\n<p>Check your holiday accommodation is secure. Lock all doors and windows at night and when you go out.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator or the owner.</p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about the security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator or owner, or contact the local police at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.psp.pt/Pages/onde-estamos.aspx\">PSP (city police)</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gnr.pt/contactos.aspx\">GNR (rural and small town police)</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-safety\">Personal safety</h3>\n\n<p>Attacks or assault, including sexual assaults are rare, but do occur. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren\u2019t spiked. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Stay with your friends, and don\u2019t go off with people you don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>By law, you must show some form of identification, if asked by the police or judicial authorities. \u00a0Sometimes a photocopy of the data page of your passport could be enough, but you may be asked to produce the original document.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gambling\">Gambling</h3>\n\n<p>Gambling is only legal in places licensed by the government, such as official casinos. Games of chance, including bingo, are illegal if they\u2019re held on unlicensed premises.</p>\n\n<p>The police may act on reports of illegal gambling in unauthorised premises without warning. Organisers, participants and anyone on the premises may be arrested, charged with a criminal offence and fined or imprisoned. If in doubt, ask if the venue is legally licensed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Selling or trafficking drugs is illegal and can have severe penalties. If you are caught taking, buying or in possession of drugs for personal use, you may be fined or arrested. Any substance you have will be confiscated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive in Portugal, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/portugal/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, make sure you have the appropriate insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive on a full, valid UK driving licence in Portugal.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Portugal, read <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-portugal\">living in Portugal</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the government guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">displaying number plates</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-a-vehicle-to-portugal\">Bringing a vehicle to Portugal</h3>\n\n<p>Tourists can bring their own vehicle to Portugal for up to 183 days in any 12-month period. You must not use your vehicle for any other purpose than tourism or loan it to anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to stay longer, you must apply to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/portugal-importation-of-motor-vehicles/importation-of-motor-vehicles-into-portugal\">Portuguese Customs authority</a> to have the car legally imported. You\u2019ll be fined if you leave the country without your car.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities\">Outdoor activities</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"beachesand-swimming\">Beaches\u00a0and swimming</h3>\n\n<p>Every year, people drown in the sea and in swimming pools in Portugal.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking close to the water\u2019s edge especially along unsupervised stretches of beaches. Waves can be unpredictable and have a strong undertow. Do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>swim at beaches that connect to or from rivers as they can have strong undercurrent</li>\n  <li>swim at beaches without lifeguards</li>\n  <li>dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be aware of rip tides, which can cause drowning. If you are caught in a rip tide, do not try to swim against it. Swim parallel to the coastline until you no longer feel the current, then try to swim towards the shore.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any lifeguard instructions and warning flags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the red flag means danger: do not go into the water</li>\n  <li>the yellow flag means caution: you can walk in the water, but you cannot swim</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More tips can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">ABTA\u2019s swim safe pages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard, particularly in the Algarve. The authorities can fine people who ignore warning signs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"walking-the-levadas-in-madeira\">Walking the levadas in Madeira</h3>\n\n<p>Walking the levadas (ancient irrigation channels) can be challenging. Choose paths that suit your fitness and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared for narrow, uneven paths and heights. Wear suitable clothing and walking boots. Take extra care if it has rained as the ground may be slippery and unstable. Check with your tour guide or local organiser that it is safe before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>Leave details of where you are going with your hotel reception and take a phone with you. Reduce the risk by walking with a group or following a guide.</p>\n\n<p>See more information about walkway closures and access restrictions on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://visitmadeira.com/en/travel-info/useful-information/advice-to-walkers/\">Visit Madeira</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires can occur anywhere in Portugal. Risk of fires is higher when the weather is hot and dry. Fires have become more common due to drought and high temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. The Portuguese authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>familiarise yourself with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aldeiasseguras.pt/\">local safety and emergency procedures</a>\n</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the Portuguese authorities</li>\n  <li>call the emergency services on 112 if you see a wildfire</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Starting a forest fire, even if it is by accident, is illegal in Portugal.</p>\n\n<p>For information about active forest fires and forecasts, visit the Portuguese Met Office website for information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ipma.pt/en/riscoincendio/rcm.pt/\">Portugal</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ipma.pt/en/riscoincendio/rcm.md/\">Madeira</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes can happen in Portugal.
