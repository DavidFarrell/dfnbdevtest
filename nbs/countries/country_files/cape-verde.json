Burglaries and muggings have been reported on the main tourist islands of Sal and Boavista.  Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Keep sight of your belongings at all times.  Leave valuables in a hotel safe if possible and do not carry large amounts of cash. Avoid unlit areas after dark. Petty crimes e.g. pick-pocketing or handbag snatching can occur, including on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your holiday accommodation is secure. Lock all doors and windows at night and when you go out. If you\u2019re worried about security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator, hotel manager or to the owner of the property.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults are rare but they do occur. Be alert and avoid secluded stretches of the beach with limited or restricted visibility.  If you become a victim of crime, contact the local police. In an emergency call 132 (police) or 131 (fire). Response times vary and service standards may not be as high as in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Cape Verde with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Cape Verde, you\u2019ll need to get a Cape Verde driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic is usually light and main road conditions are generally of a reasonable quality.</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, scooter or quad bike, make sure it\u2019s in good condition and that it\u2019s fully insured. Quad biking is considered to be an extreme sport and may not be included in your travel insurance policy. Check whether you need additional insurance and make sure it covers you for the cost of medical care and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Crash helmets are needed by law. Your insurance policy may be invalidated if you have an accident and you\u2019re not wearing a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Cape Verde is from mid August to mid October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>Intercity bus services can be dangerous due to poor driving. Taxis hailed from hotels are generally reliable. In Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition. Car rental is widely available on the islands of Santiago, Sal, Boa Vista and S\u00e3o Vicente.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Sea conditions around Cape Verde are sometimes dangerous. Take local advice before travelling by sea. Travel by sea to the southern islands of Fogo and Brava in particular can often be disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>Take care if you participate in water sports, swimming, boating and fishing. Tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Respect the warning flags and keep within sight of the lifeguard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>The political situation is generally stable, but you should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings</p>\n",

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>.

Travellers venturing into areas of altitude may suffer from altitude sickness, which can potentially be life threatening. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Cape Verde as having a moderate risk of Zika virus transmission. There is a low risk of malaria in the capital city, Praia (Santiago Island).

Further reports in February 2023 suggest that most cases reported stayed in the Santa Maria region on the island of Sal. You should follow the health advice issued by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/675/shigella-cases-reported-in-travellers-returning-from-cape-verde\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> and make sure you are observing standard food, water and personal hygiene precautions, such as washing hands and only using bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth etc.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-medical-care\">Local medical care</h3>\n\n<p>Medical facilities in Cape Verde are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. The largest hospitals are in Praia and Mindelo, with smaller medical facilities and clinics located throughout the country. Medical facilities are particularly limited on the island of Boavista. The islands of Brava and Santo Ant\u00e3o no longer have functioning airports, so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is extremely difficult from these two islands.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 130 (Santiago Island) and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",
