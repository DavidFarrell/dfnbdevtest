They sometimes also operate in hotel lobbies, cafes and restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>Keep your personal belongings, including passports and money, safe. Keep an eye on luggage, including in the overhead baggage compartment, when travelling on trains to and from the airport.</p>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing and bag-snatching is common in the following areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the central station</li>\n  <li>N\u00f8rreport Station</li>\n  <li>the main shopping street, Str\u00f8get</li>\n  <li>other areas popular with tourists such as Christiania, Nyhavn and Kongens Nytorv</li>\n  <li>inside Copenhagen Kastrup airport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should take extra care in Christiania and N\u00f8rrebro, particularly late at night.
