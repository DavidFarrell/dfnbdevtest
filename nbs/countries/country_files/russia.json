However, in St Petersburg gangs have targeted tourists for street crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dating-services-scams\">Dating services scams</h3>\n\n<p>Dating services scams have affected British nationals. Never send money or buy items for anyone you have not met in person.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money-transfer-scams\">Money transfer scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of sending money through untraceable transfer services. British nationals have lost money when sending it to unknown recipients without checking they\u2019re genuine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fake-police-checks\">Fake police checks</h3>\n\n<p>The police do not need a reason to stop, question or detain individuals. Fake police officers have harassed and robbed tourists. If you\u2019re stopped, always insist on seeing identification. Report any harassment or crime to the nearest police office.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-checks\">Passport checks</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry your passport with you as ID. Police carry out random checks, especially during periods of high security. You could be fined or detained for up to 48 hours if you cannot show your passport when asked. Copies are not accepted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Do not use or carry drugs. You can be prosecuted for possessing even small quantities of any drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"restricted-military-areas\">Restricted military areas</h3>\n\n<p>Access to certain areas, such as military and border zones, is restricted. You must get permission from local authorities before entering. You can find a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?searchres=&amp;bpas=cd00000&amp;a3=102000496&amp;a3type=1&amp;a3value=%CF%EE%F1%F2%E0%ED%EE%E2%EB%E5%ED%E8%E5&amp;a6=102000066&amp;a6type=1&amp;a6value=%CF%F0%E0%E2%E8%F2%E5%EB%FC%F1%F2%E2%EE&amp;a15=&amp;a15type=1&amp;a15value=&amp;a7type=1&amp;a7from=&amp;a7to=&amp;a7date=04.07.1992&amp;a8=470&amp;a8type=1&amp;a1=&amp;a0=&amp;a16=&amp;a16type=1&amp;a16value=&amp;a17=&amp;a17type=1&amp;a17value=&amp;a4=&amp;a4type=1&amp;a4value=&amp;a23=&amp;a23type=1&amp;a23value=&amp;textpres=&amp;sort=7&amp;x=73&amp;y=11\">list of restricted areas online</a> (in Russian and the site may not be accessible from outside of Russia).</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have permission, you may be arrested, fined or deported. Check with your tour operator or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://london.mid.ru/en/\">Russian Embassy</a> in the UK if you\u2019re unsure whether a tour or excursion will take you into a restricted area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photographing-military-sites\">Photographing military sites</h3>\n\n<p>Photography is not permitted at any military, secure or official sites (including airports). There may not be warning signs in locations where photography is banned. You could be detained or arrested if you break the law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-drones\">Using drones</h3>\n\n<p>Due to current military activities, some regions have prohibited the use of all drones. Check restrictions with the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You must get permission from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.favt.ru/\">Russian aviation authority</a> (in Russian) before using any unmanned aircraft systems (drones) in Russian airspace. You must tell them the flight route at least 24 hours in advance and keep in regular contact with them before and during the flight. You will be fined if you do not comply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cybersecurity-laws\">Cybersecurity laws</h3>\n\n<p>There are increasing restrictions to limit accessibility and content posted on the internet, including social media platforms. Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Twitter and LinkedIn are blocked in Russia. Access to other websites can be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>More information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rkn.gov.ru/\">Federal Service for Surveillance of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media</a> (in Russian).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"racial-discrimination\">Racial discrimination</h3>\n\n<p>Most visitors experience no problems but racial discrimination can happen in some areas. If you\u2019re of African, Asian or Caribbean descent, you may receive unwanted attention in public places. Take care, particularly when travelling late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia. However, attitudes towards the LGBT+ community and LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK and vary in different locations. Government officials have made derogatory comments to LGBT+ individuals. New legislation bans people from promoting \u2018non-traditional sexual relations\u2019 to minors. Foreign citizens could face fines, up to 15 days in jail, or deportation. Public displays of affection may receive negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, Russia was ranked 46 out of 49 European countries for LGBT+ rights by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rainbow-europe.org/#8656/0/0\">ILGA-Europe</a>. There are no laws to protect LGBT+ people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Recent laws targeting LGBT+ communities include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2012, Moscow Pride was banned for 100 years</li>\n  <li>in 2022 , new laws banned the \u2018demonstration of LGBT information, promotion of non-traditional sexual relations and change of gender\u2019 to children and adults through the internet, films, advertisement, audio visual services and books (the \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Harassment, threats, and acts of violence towards the LGBT+ community have increased. Penalties for foreign nationals may include arrest and detention, fines and deportation.</p>\n\n<p>The North Caucasus republics are particularly intolerant of the LGBT+ community. There have been reports of the arrest, torture and killing of gay men in Chechnya, allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Read <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-activities\">Religious activities</h3>\n\n<p>Some religious activities are restricted, including preaching and distributing religious materials.</p>\n\n<p>Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are considered an extremist organisation in Russia. They can face harassment from authorities, including detention, particularly at places of worship.</p>\n\n<p>Some other minority religious groups, like Scientologists, also face discrimination.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Russia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/russia/\">RAC Russia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a valid UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Russia. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety in Russia is poor and road conditions unpredictable. Take care when driving, take account of weather conditions and consider avoiding driving at night. Do not drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road. Do not pick up hitchhikers.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic police will often stop drivers for spot checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-vehicles-into-russia\">Bringing vehicles into Russia</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive into Russia, you must declare your vehicle to the customs authority on entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for up to one year.</p>\n\n<p>Green cards are no longer accepted as proof of car or road insurance. Check insurance requirements before entering.</p>\n\n<p>For questions about bringing a vehicle into Russia, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://london.mid.ru/en/\">Russian Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avoiding-unregistered-taxis\">Avoiding unregistered taxis</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals travelling in unregistered taxis have been victims of crime. Taxis that look official can be unlicensed. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use a local taxi app to call a registered taxi</li>\n  <li>ask your hotel to call a taxi or give you the number of a reputable company</li>\n  <li>agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not flag down a taxi or share a taxi with strangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Railway stations have airport-style security. Many railway services require passengers to show their passports on boarding.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling by overnight train, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Do not look after luggage for other travelers or let it be stored in your compartment.</p>\n\n<p>Do not leave your sleeping compartment empty, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains, there may be an extra security device attached to the fitted handle or lock. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being opened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Air space will close during drone attacks. This has led to frequent and unpredictable delays, diversions and cancellations to flights in and out of airports in European Russia.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on domestic flights to a number of airports in southern Russia, with disruption to internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-safety\">Air safety</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>) lists all known airlines in Russia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.  Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government has sanctioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Aeroflot</li>\n  <li>Rossiya Airlines</li>\n  <li>Ural Airlines</li>\n  <li>Russian Railways</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British nationals can buy flight tickets as long as the journey is starting in, or within, Russia without breaching UK sanctions.

If staff need to travel internally, they may use airlines which also fly to internationally to countries where international safety standards are maintained or on Western manufactured aircraft.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travellers-with-limited-mobility\">Travellers with limited mobility</h3>\n\n<p>Wheelchair access can be limited in some public areas.
