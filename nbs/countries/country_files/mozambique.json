Disputes over the subsequent results have seen almost daily demonstrations in multiple parts of the country including the capital, Maputo. While the majority of the protests have been peaceful they can turn violent without warning. Stay away from crowds, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in areas of Cabo Delgado province dating back to January 2019. There was a large-scale attack on Palma in March/April 2021 in which dozens of people were killed. Since May/June 2022 there has been a series of attacks in the Ancuabe,Metuge and Chiure districts of Cabo Delgado and in the Memba and Erati districts of Nampula province just to the south. Although there have been no recent reports of attacks in the Mecula, Mavago and Marrupa districts of Niassa Province, you should remain vigilant in these areas, as the situation may change with no prior warning. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. Attacks have been carried out on the mainland and on islands off the coast, including in areas frequented by foreigners. There is an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. There is also a threat of kidnap in Mozambique, which is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Coastal areas are at risk from tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi, Licungo, Pungue, Buzi, Limpopo and Save. The rainy season (November to April) will also make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable.</p>\n\n<p>There continues to be a risk of cyclone and tropical storm weather systems during the rainy season (November to April). These may lead to widespread damage to infrastructure as well as disruption to basic services including communications, power and water supplies.</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inam.gov.mz/\">National Meterological Institute</a>\u00a0(in Portuguese) for the latest information and follow instructions from the local authorities. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to Mozambique are trouble-free, but violent crime does occur and there have been cases of criminal kidnappings. You should take extra care. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you\u2019re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates.

In the central and southern provinces (Sofala, Tete, Manica, Gaza, Inhambane, Maputo), mines may still exist in remote areas away from main routes. Seek advice from district authorities if you\u2019re travelling in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>UK driving licences are valid for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer you should get an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit</a> or apply for a Mozambican licence. The office which issues driving licences has now reopened. It is an offence not to carry your driving licence with you when driving. Be ready to present original car documentation when requested by the police.</p>\n\n<p>Third party insurance cover is compulsory. You can buy this at most land borders. You should carry two reflective triangles and a reflective vest in your vehicle at all times. You must wear the reflective vest when repairing, loading or unloading a vehicle. Police officers sometimes attempt to extract bribes from tourists. Don\u2019t pay a bribe to anyone. If you are stopped by the police, ask for a clear explanation of the offence and a written fine that can be paid at a police station.</p>\n\n<p>Only travel by road outside Maputo and other major cities during daylight. Where possible, keep to major roads and travel in convoy in rural areas. Fuel is often only available in larger towns.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of carjacking, particularly in Maputo but also between Boane and the Swaziland border crossing points of Namaacha and Goba. Keep your car doors locked while driving. Be particularly vigilant when arriving at or leaving residential properties after dark. Avoid driving alone at night.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t pick up strangers or stop to help distressed motorists or pedestrians. Hijackers sometimes use these techniques to trick motorists into stopping their vehicle. If in doubt, drive directly to a police station.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic accidents are common in Mozambique due to the condition of the roads and poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads.</p>\n\n<p>Overland travel on public transport can be hazardous due to poor vehicle and road conditions. If you doubt a vehicle\u2019s condition, make alternative arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Low-lying areas around major rivers flood regularly during the rainy season (November - April) making many roads impassable. Check local conditions before travelling. Make sure you have emergency supplies, including a first aid kit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx\">IATA Operational Safety Audit</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/issa/Pages/registry.aspx?Query=all\">IATA Standard Safety Assessment</a>. These lists aren\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Mozambique.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=C9\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Flights operated by the Government-owned airline LAM are prone to cancellation without notice. Check your flight information between 24 and 48 hours before your scheduled departure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see <a href=\"/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>President Filipe Nyusi was re-elected for a second term in October 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Protests or demonstrations can occur with little notice. You should remain vigilant, monitor local media reports, avoid demonstrations and large crowds, and carry ID with you at all times. Make sure you have a means of communication with you at all times and that your mobile phone is charged.</p>\n\n",

Attacks may also take place outside of these areas. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, including attacks on vehicles. In June 2019, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack for the first time. There was a large-scale attack on Palma in March/April 2021, also claimed by the Islamic State, in which dozens of people were killed. Since mid-2022, groups with links to Islamist extremism have also carried out attacks in the districts of Memba and Erati in Nampula province.</p>\n\n<p>Although there have been no recent reports of attacks in the Mecula, Mavago and Marrupa districts of Niassa Province, you should remain vigilant in these areas, as the situation may change with no prior warning.  There are heightened security measures in place throughout Cabo Delgado province, including road blocks and vehicle checks. There are regular clashes between insurgents, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces in areas where we advise against all or all but essential travel.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n<p>Due to the presence of groups with links to Islamist extremism, there is a threat of kidnap in Mozambique. The threat is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working in Mozambique, you should follow your employer\u2019s local security guidelines. Employers are strongly advised to take professional security advice, be vigilant at all times and review security measures regularly. Keep others informed of your travel plans and vary your routines. Make sure your accommodation is secure and consider pre-deployment training or travelling under close protection, particularly if working in Cabo Delgado.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",
