If you overstay, you could get a fine and possibly be deported. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or visa if you want to stay in the country for longer than planned. If you\u2019re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on visas, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uzembassy.uk/\">Uzbek Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Border guards check the stamp on exit to ensure that travellers do not exceed the 30-day period.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-uzbek-authorities\">Registering with the Uzbek authorities</h2>\n\n<p>You must register with the local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> (Department of Foreign Travel and Exit) within 3 days of your arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the 3-day period. If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, you\u2019ll be asked for your passport at check-in. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport. If you do not register within 3 days of arrival in the country, you get fined for each day you are late.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying in a private house, your host should register you directly with their local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> or on the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than 3 days, you\u2019ll need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of where you\u2019ve been in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. If you are unable to account for your whereabouts, you could get a fined for each day you are late and possibly be deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-through-uzbekistan\">Travelling through Uzbekistan</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling through Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents and camping, you must register yourself. Register online through the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>, within 3 days of arrival. When you\u2019re registering online, you\u2019ll have to pay a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment you can only pay the tourist tax online with an Uzbek debit card in local currency \u2013 seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"uzbek-british-dual-nationality\">Uzbek-British dual nationality</h2>\n\n<p>Uzbekistan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and are also a British national, the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. If you\u2019re arrested or detained, consular access is unlikely to be granted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan#Vaccine_recommendations\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Uzbekistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/%D1%9Ezbekiston-respublikasi-hududiga-kirib-kelayotgan-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-bozhhona-qoidalari\">goods you can take into or out of Uzbekistan</a> (in Uzbek and Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty, including large amounts of money.</p>\n\n<p>You must complete a customs declaration form. You should fill out 2 copies of the form. Make sure customs officials sign and stamp both copies. You\u2019ll need to show one at customs as you enter Uzbekistan and the other when you leave. If you have currency or valuables you did not declare, officials may confiscate them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-and-out-of-uzbekistan\">Taking money into and out of Uzbekistan</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to complete a foreign currency declaration form\u00a0when you arrive and keep a copy.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate form for visitors carrying significant amounts of money: the threshold is 10,000 US dollars. Visitors cannot take more than 10,000 US dollars out of the country. The forms are available in the arrival area of the airport.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot leave Uzbekistan with more foreign currency than you brought with you.</p>\n\n<p>Bring enough cash for your entire stay. Credit cards are not widely accepted outside Tashkent and the main tourist areas of Samarkand and Bukhara. Travellers cheques are not normally accepted. There are very few ATMs. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency.</p>\n\n<p>Only change money through official exchange booths. It is illegal to change money on the black market, and there are harsh penalties. Official exchange booths will not accept damaged or marked bank notes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medication\">Medication</h3>\n\n<p>Before you travel to Uzbekistan with prescription or non- prescription medicines, you should check the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan\u2019s list of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/ayrim-horizhiy-davlatlarning-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-zhoriy-qilingan-bozhhona-qoidalari\">prohibited medicines and the amount of medication you\u2019re allowed to import</a> (in Uzbek and Russian).</p>\n\n<p>You should carry a doctor\u2019s prescription if you travel with prescription medicines and declare them on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession can lead to civil or criminal proceedings\u00a0if you do not have a prescription, or if you\u2019re carrying more than you need for the visit and do not declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.</p>\n\n",

This includes the Palace of Forums in Tashkent and sometimes local bazaars not normally visited by tourists. While restrictions have been relaxed recently, you should check before using a camera, especially near airports, border checkpoints, military barracks, bridges, police stations and metro stations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>You must get a licence to import drones before you arrive in Uzbekistan. If you import or use drones without permission, you can get a fine or be detained. The authorities can also confiscate your equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are illegal, not recognised and still frowned upon socially.

You should get your licence translated into either Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier. This is not a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Take care as many roads have poor surfaces and bad lighting.</p>\n\n<p>In Uzbekistan:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>drive on the right</li>\n  <li>vehicles approaching a roundabout have the right of way over vehicles already in the roundabout</li>\n  <li>seatbelts are compulsory for drivers and passengers</li>\n  <li>it is illegal to drive while using a mobile phone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-buses\">Taxis and buses</h3>\n\n<p>You should use licensed taxis whenever possible, this includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>official taxis at the airport</li>\n  <li>taxis hailed using apps like Yandex or My Taxi</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlicensed taxis are still common, despite licensing laws.

Where possible opt for modern vehicles.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Uzbekistan.</p>\n\n<p>On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling long distances by train. If you must travel overnight, keep valuables in a safe place. Do not leave your belongings in the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.

You should minimise your exposure to outside air by staying in an air-conditioned indoor place as much as possible, with windows and doors closed and well sealed. Wash all fruit, vegetables and other foods, which might have been exposed. Regularly damp-dust all indoor surfaces, washing your hands afterwards. It is unclear when the air quality will improve.
