Some demonstrations attract large numbers of people, and they can occasionally turn violent.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations may be more common in the months before and after Presidential elections on 19 November.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid all protests, demonstrations and marches</li>\n  <li>exercise normal caution at any large gathering</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have also been occasional Falklands-related protests including outside the British Embassy and British-affiliated businesses in Argentina.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h3>\n\n<p>Groups of demonstrators (\u2018piqueteros\u2019) sometimes block major roads during times of social unrest. This can include blocking the major routes into and out of Buenos Aires City. This can cause significant delays.</p>\n\n<p>When planning to travel:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor the local news</li>\n  <li>do not attempt to cross blockades</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves normally work in teams of 2 or more and tend to target small bags and pockets. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always keep a close eye on your personal possessions</li>\n  <li>not carry all your valuables in one place</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing jewellery</li>\n  <li>keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe</li>\n  <li>avoid isolated or poorly lit areas at night</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You might be asked for a photo ID when paying with a credit card so carry one with you but keep it secured. A money belt under your clothes is the safest option.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"theft\">Theft</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves and pickpockets operate on public transport, bus and train terminals.</p>\n\n<p>Thieves posing as hotel guests snatch bags while tourists are checking into hotels or hostels. Handbags can be cut open in crowded places and mobile phones have been snatched while being used on the street. Thieves on motorbikes can snatch bags from pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Thefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars, are common.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep your valuables out of sight or close to you</li>\n  <li>avoid hanging bags on the back of your chair</li>\n  <li>avoid using ATMs at night</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings when withdrawing money</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-crime-and-scams\">Street crime and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to street crime, especially thieves (often women) using distraction techniques. A common form of distraction theft reported in Buenos Aires is the \u2018mustard scam\u2019. Thieves will rob tourists while an accomplice pretends to help remove mustard that has been accidentally sprayed on them. If this happens to you, politely but firmly refuse assistance and walk away.</p>\n\n<p>In Buenos Aires, be particularly cautious in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Palermo</li>\n  <li>San Telmo</li>\n  <li>La Boca</li>\n  <li>Retiro</li>\n  <li>Florida Street</li>\n  <li>9 de Julio</li>\n  <li>Avenida de Mayo</li>\n  <li>Rivadavia Avenues near the obelisk</li>\n  <li>the Retiro Bus terminal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Mendoza, be particularly cautious downtown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent and armed robberies can happen in the streets immediately outside the Caminito tourist area in La Boca. Stay in the designated tourist area where there are high-visibility police patrols. If robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Kidnappings and \u2018express kidnappings\u2019 occasionally occur in Argentina. Victims are held and forced to empty their bank accounts in different ATMs after which they are normally quickly released.</p>\n\n<p>For English-language assistance, safety tips issued by the City of Buenos Aires, or to file a police report online, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://turistas.seguridadciudad.gob.ar/\">the Buenos Aires Police website</a> (only accessible in Argentina). You can also contact the Tourist Police, who are available 24 hours:</p>\n\n<p>Telephone: +54 911 5050 9260/3293 (from a mobile)</p>\n\n<p>Telephone: 155 5050 9260/3293 (from a local landline)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks and other foods can be spiked and could put you at risk of robbery or assault. Do not leave food or drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and do not accept them from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risk of bringing people you don\u2019t know well into your accommodation. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but there have been reports of foreign tourists being robbed or assaulted after inviting new acquaintances, met online or in person, into their accommodation. Be alert to the possible use of \u2018date rape\u2019 and other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Possessing even very small quantities can lead to a lengthy prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Argentine society is open and diverse. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is rare. Same-sex marriage is legal. Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT travellers</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-action-against-oil-and-gas-companies\">Legal action against oil and gas companies</h3>\n\n<p>The government of Argentina has stated that it intends to pursue legal action against oil and gas companies engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the Falkland Islands. If you\u2019re travelling to Argentina and think you may be affected by this type of legal action, seek independent legal advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>If you take part in extreme or adventure sports (including paragliding, climbing, off-road driving and hot air ballooning), make sure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>adequate safety precautions are in place</li>\n  <li>you only use reputable operators and insist on training</li>\n  <li>your travel insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will have to pay for most helicopter rescues, including in Mount Aconcagua.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Argentina. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You will need an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> to drive in Argentina.</p>\n\n<p>Respect for speed limits and traffic signals varies  and drivers can make unexpected manoeuvres. Crime against car users, particularly when stationary at traffic lights, is a problem.\u00a0 Always keep car windows closed and doors locked in major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving in the province of Misiones, close to the borders with Paraguay and Brazil; the area is used to smuggle goods. Seek local advice from customs officials if you intend to drive in this area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Book taxis in advance if possible. If you hail a taxi in the street, only use a \u2018radio taxi\u2019. These have a clearly visible logo on the car doors.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/transportes-autorizados-pasajeros\">City of Buenos Aires\u2019 government site for a downloadable list of registered taxi companies</a> with their contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Flights from Argentina can be unreliable and susceptible to delays and cancellations. Check the status of your flight with your airline or travel company before travelling to the airport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been cases of disruption by activist groups and unions against British-flagged shipping, and shipping involved in hydrocarbons or fishing activity in the Falkland Islands. If you\u2019re responsible for a vessel, contact your agent or the local authorities before travelling. Most cruise ships and visiting tourists should not be affected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Many northern provinces experience occasional flooding. This can disrupt transport and delivery of food. Flash floods can occur during heavy rains, in provinces including Buenos Aires. Monitor local media and follow instructions given by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>The Copahue Volcano on the Argentina-Chile border erupts occasionally, and residents are evacuated. If you\u2019re travelling to this area, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n",
