Avoid travelling in the bush along this border for hunting or prospecting.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nWild animals in the bush, including venomous snakes, are unpredictable and do kill. Whether you are travelling on land or water, you are at risk of potentially fatal animal attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Adventure sports, including in the Victoria Falls area, carry risks.\u00a0Serious accidents and deaths sometimes occur. The quality of medical care varies greatly. Follow safety instructions closely and make sure your insurance policy covers you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer, you will need to get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> or a Zambian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving. Vehicles are often poorly lit, inadequately maintained and badly driven. Drink driving and driving while talking on a mobile phone is illegal but commonplace. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rtsa.org.zm/\">The Road Traffic and Safety Agency</a> will prosecute traffic offenders through a fast track court system.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel at night in rural areas can be hazardous. Abandoned vehicles, pedestrians and stray animals are a danger. Many roads are severely pot-holed or otherwise unsafe, especially during the rainy season (November-April) when bridges and roads risk being washed away by sudden floods. There are frequent fatal crashes. You should avoid driving at night outside the main towns.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicle hijackings happen across the country from time to time. Take particular care when approaching locked gateways at night. Don\u2019t stop to give lifts to people at the roadside. Watch out for objects that have been placed to block the road. Be vigilant, keep all vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving, and remain aware of your surroundings, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Travel by long-distance public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions. Minibuses used in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded, poorly maintained and badly driven.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air Travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.
