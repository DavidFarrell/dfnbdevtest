Check with your travel provider ahead of your travel. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a> pages.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country. The kidnap threat is most significant in northern and central Mali, and increasingly in the south. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks and kidnaps targeting Westerners in Bamako and across southern Mali. We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night and in places frequented by westerners. In July 2022, the AQ-affiliated Islamist terrorist group, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) made public statements setting out their intention to conduct attacks in Bamako. A series of recent attacks in central and southern Mali demonstrate a deteriorating security situation and heightened risk of attacks in the capital. In July 2022, terrorists targeted the Kati military camp, just 15km from the centre of Bamako.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, as these are likely to be targets. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship,  businesses with western interests and non-governmental organisations are also likely to be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods and during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods.</p>\n\n<p>At times when the risk is heightened, you should expect a robust security presence, particularly in Bamako. This can include police patrols, police security checks in restaurants and hotels and vehicle and personal security checks. Foreigners are not exempt. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is an ongoing risk. Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Bamako. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days\u2019 stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako). See Safety and Security.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited, especially outside Bamako. If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bamako\">British Embassy in Bamako</a>. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the\u00a0FCDO\u00a0being able to evacuate you in an emergency. If you need urgent help because something has happened to a friend or relative abroad, contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on 020 7008 5000 (24 hours).</p>\n\n",

If your travel is essential, we advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night.</p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is an ongoing risk. . Due to the withdrawal of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Mali. You should remain vigilant and monitor local media for any developments.</p>\n\n<p>Inter and intra-communal security incidents persist in many parts of the country, most notably in Mopti and Segou regions. In some instances, terrorist groups have become involved in these conflicts. In March 2019, 160 villagers were killed by masked gunmen in a single attack in Ogossagou in central Mali. Landmines are used by groups operating in Centre, North and North East Mali.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in Segou and Sikasso has sharply declined since 2020 with a string of notable attacks in Segou region and increasing levels of terrorist related activity in Sikasso region. Terrorists are known to operate out of national parks and forest areas. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>On 1 June 2022, gunmen targeted and killed three aid workers\u00a0in the Kayes region (bordering Senegal and Mauritania). There have been other known attacks on aid workers across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in Mali can be difficult and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>On 24 May 2021, a second military coup resulted in the arrests and resignation of the former transitional President Bah N\u2019Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta, former Vice President, has assumed control and appointed a government for the rest of the transition period.</p>\n\n<p>Political unrest is ongoing. Regular, large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako, resulting in burning of tyres, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have previously been reports of several deaths and injuries. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and may see a heavy police and security presence. Protests have taken place recently in Bamako. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should leave the area immediately, remain vigilant, and follow the local news as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. You should stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence.

Checkpoints are in place from approximately 9pm until dawn.</p>\n\n<p>The use of taxi services in Bamako is not recommended due to low standards of vehicle maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Keep vehicle and personal identification documents with you at all times while travelling by road. Approach security checkpoints slowly and comply with instructions given. There have been incidents late at night where people dressed as policemen have demanded money from drivers in Bamako. Ask to see identification. Don\u2019t resist if the person is armed.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions off the main roads are often poor, especially in the rainy season (June to October). Other road users may drive dangerously. You should take particular care and attention when driving in urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a vehicle accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report immediately.

We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night and in places frequented by westerners.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, as these are likely to be targets. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship, businesses with western interests and non-governmental organisations are also likely to be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>During public holidays and festivals, including New Year and Eid celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>Large gatherings can also include music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. The Festival au D\u00e9sert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 and has not taken place since due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country are also vulnerable to attack. There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are known to operate out of national parks and forest areas.</p>\n\n<p>Notable attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 22 July 2022, there was an attack on the Kati military base, 15km from Bamako city centre, killing one soldier. Seven attackers were also killed.</li>\n  <li>On 21 July 2022, there were six attacks across central and southern Mali targeting Malian armed forces targets, including Kolokani, Kono, Douentza, Bapho, Segou and S\u00e9var\u00e9.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 16 July 2022, terrorists attacked a security post at Zantiguila, approximately 70km from Bamako on the road to Segou, killing six.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>On 18 June 2022, terrorists attacked the villages of Diallassagou, Dianweli and Deguessagou, killing at least 132 civilians.</li>\n  <li>On 22 January 2022, terrorists attacked the BARKHANE camp in Gao, resulting in the death of one French soldier.</li>\n  <li>On 2 April 2021, terrorists attacked the MINUSMA camp in Aguelhok, which resulted in the death of four peacekeepers.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 15 March 2021, terrorists attacks a Malian Army security post in Tessit, killing 33 soldiers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>On 14 June 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military convey approximately 160km north of Segou town, killing 24 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 6 April 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military base in Bamba, Gao region, killing 25 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 26 January 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military camp in Sokolo, Segou region, killing 20 soldiers.</li>\n  <li>On 24 February 2019, insurgents attacked the Koulikoro Training Centre, the main training base in Mali for the European Union Training Mission, approximately 55km northeast of Bamako. Four Malian military personnel were injured.</li>\n  <li>In June 2017, terrorists attacked Le Campement resort in Kangaba, on the outskirts of Bamako, which resulted in a number of deaths.</li>\n  <li>In March 2016, gunmen attacked the headquarters of the European Union Training Mission in the centre of Bamako.</li>\n  <li>In November 2015, terrorists attacked the Radisson Hotel in Bamako, killing a number of hostages including foreign nationals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Following French/African military intervention in Mali in January 2013, there is a high threat of retaliatory kidnap or attack against western interests. There have been a number of bomb attacks in Gao, Kidal, Timbuktu and in Khalil in recent years. Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, vehicle ambushes, small arms fire and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Malian, MINUSMA (the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali) and international security forces are regularly targeted, particularly in the regions of Kidal, Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Menaka, and attacks are frequent.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of terrorism is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. The threat to western interests in the region remains.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP). These groups operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. There is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country. The kidnap threat is most significant in northern and central Mali, and increasingly in the south. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks and kidnaps targeting Westerners in Bamako and across southern Mali. We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night, and to vary your daily routine. Avoid walking around the city alone after dark.  Westerners have been kidnapped in Mali, including in Kidal, Kayes, Timbuktu, Gao and Hombori, and the wider Sahel region.</p>\n\n<p>Recent kidnap incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In May 2022, three Italian nationals and a Togolese national were kidnapped by armed men in Sincina, near the southern border with Burkina Faso</li>\n  <li>A French national was kidnapped from Gao in April 2021</li>\n  <li>Four hostages, including French and Italian nationals, were released in October 2020.</li>\n  <li>An Italian and Canadian national were kidnapped in December 2018 in Burkina Faso and were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in northeast Mali after reportedly escaping.</li>\n  <li>In May 2019, two French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped in northern Benin by an armed group. The guide was found dead and the hostages were later rescued in northern Burkina Faso whilst reportedly on their way to Mali</li>\n  <li>In January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in northern Burkina Faso and subsequently found dead.</li>\n  <li>Several foreign nationals were kidnapped in from the northeastern region of neighbouring Burkina Faso in September 2018.</li>\n  <li>In February 2017 a Colombian nun was kidnapped in Sikasso region, in the south of Mali, and has since been released in October 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are working or travelling in Mali, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, and shopping areas, and places frequented by westerners like hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should vary your daily routine and avoid walking around the city alone after dark.  You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-terrorist-threat-in-the-sahel\">The terrorist threat in the Sahel</h3>\n\n<p>There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include JNIM, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Sahel Province  (ISSP), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine, Katiba Macina and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for JNIM. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n",
