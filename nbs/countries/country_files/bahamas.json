There are police patrols in the main tourist areas.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant at all times and don\u2019t walk alone away from the main hotels, tourist areas, beaches and downtown Nassau, particularly after dark. Take care if travelling on local bus services after dusk on routes away from the main tourist areas. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. Robbers may be armed. Don\u2019t resist in the event of an attempted robbery.

Be careful when renting jet skis and other water sports equipment as many companies and individuals offering water sports activities are unregistered. People have been killed or seriously injured using jet skis and other watercraft carelessly, or by the reckless behaviour of others. There have been reports of sexual assaults on foreign nationals by jet ski operators in Nassau.</p>\n\n<p>There have reports that some organisers of day excursions are using bait to attract marine life, including sharks, leading to increased shark attacks in the immediate vicinity. Some have proven fatal. Never swim in water where the water has been baited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regattas-and-festivals\">Regattas and Festivals</h3>\n\n<p>Regattas and festivals are common across all islands in The Bahamas; they do see an increase in street crime including risk of sexual assaults and robbery, though most tourists participate safely and securely. You should take sensible precautions and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times. Avoid displaying jewellery or items that may attract criminals. Do not leave your drinks unattended, practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events. Overnight visitors should also make sensible extra checks when booking properties, such as asking about local security provision and surrounding street lighting.

In preparation for a hurricane, you should ensure your residence is secure, you have sufficient drinking water, and you have considered your means of escape in the event of a tidal surge (including access to life jackets). A list of government-provided <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://opm.gov.bs/updated-hurricane-shelter-storm-list/\">hurricane shelters for all islands</a> is available here. You should follow the advice of local authorities, including on any evacuations. Due to the risk of flight cancellation, many local residents will take early decisions to avoid hurricane paths even before an evacuation is ordered.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">tropical cyclones guidance page</a> for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you\u2019re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.</p>\n\n",
