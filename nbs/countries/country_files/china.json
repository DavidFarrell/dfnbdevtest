See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.

See \u2018<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and Security\u2019</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide face-to-face assistance within China is limited, and will need to be arranged in advance. If you\u2019re in China and need consular support, call +86 (0)10 5192 4000 or the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0in London on +44 (0) 207 008 5000 or contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy and Consulates-General in Shanghai and Guangzhou provide travel documentary services to British nationals. However, you will need to make an appointment online before coming to a Consulate. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-china\">Notarial and Documentary Services Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Following protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there were reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong when the border was last open. This included reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices had been checked at border crossings. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>China has a zero tolerance policy on drugs. There are severe penalties for drugs-related offences including the death penalty. Police often raid bars and nightclubs checking for the use of illicit substances. Raids on private homes have also occurred. Police also have the power to detain or prevent you from leaving China if you are involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven\u2019t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to travel to Tibet without getting the correct permits. The Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) can be closed to foreigners without notice. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region</a>.</p>\n\n<p>China doesn\u2019t recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter China on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>. If you\u2019ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban and industrialised areas in China, and may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/beijing/\">pollution index levels</a> for many cities in real time. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/health\">Health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The typhoon season in China normally runs from May to November.

                    "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but they do occur, including through drinks being spiked. You should take reasonable precautions - do not leave drinks unattended and avoid accepting drinks from strangers. Women, travelling alone or with female friends, could be at greater risk - see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Serious crime against foreigners is relatively rare, but incidents do occur and less serious crime is not unusual. You should take care of your belongings at major tourist sites and other busy places, particularly where foreigners gather. If your passport is lost or stolen, you will need to go to the nearest police station or Public Security Bureau and get a report of the incident.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling in unmarked or unmetered taxis, as there have been incidents of sexual assault and robbery against foreigners. In marked taxis, make sure someone knows where you are and try to take a note of the taxi\u2019s number.</p>\n\n<p>Disputes over taxi fares can occur and quickly escalate. Insist on paying the metered fare and ask for a receipt; this has the taxi number on it.</p>\n\n<p>Do not hike alone in isolated areas, including on the Great Wall. If you do, always leave your itinerary, mobile number and expected time of return at your hotel or with a third party.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of attack from armed criminals in remote areas. The areas bordering on Siberia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Laos and Burma are poorly policed. In Yunnan Province, drug smuggling and other crimes are increasing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of scams in popular tourist areas. A common example is the \u2018tea tasting\u2019 scam or \u2018massage\u2019 scam. You may be invited to visit a bar, to participate in tea tasting or for a massage, but then face demands for an exorbitant fee. This can be followed by threats or actual violence, and credit card fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Check QR code stickers on rental bicycles carefully before using them. There have been cases of the legitimate barcode being replaced with a false code, which redirects money to a different account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h2>\n<p>Before entering into a contract in China you should take legal advice, both in the United Kingdom and in China. Contracts entered into in the United Kingdom are not always enforced by Chinese courts.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute, the Chinese authorities may prohibit you from leaving China until the matter is resolved. This is known as a travel ban. For more detailed advice on business risks and commercial disputes, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/commercial-disputes-in-china\">our guide on commercial disputes in China</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of British nationals being detained against their will to extort money or intimidate them have occurred. It is rare for violence to be used, but the threat of violence is a recurring theme. You should report any threats of violence to the Chinese police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"tibet-and-the-tibet-autonomous-region-tar\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)</h3>\n\n<p>You can only travel to the TAR on an organised tour and you must get a permit first, through a specialised travel agent in China. Chinese authorities sometimes stop issuing these without notice, and also restrict travel to Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures in neighbouring Provinces, even if you have a permit.  You should check with tour operators or travel agents and monitor this travel advice and other media for information.</p>\n\n<p>Once in Tibet you should avoid demonstrations and other large public gatherings. Ongoing political and ethnic tensions can lead to unrest and protest, sometimes violent. Security measures will be tight and unauthorised gatherings may be dispersed by force. Do not film or photograph any such activities or outbreaks of violence. Local authorities will react negatively if you\u2019re found carrying letters or packages from Tibetan nationals to be posted in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>Photography in Buddhist monasteries needs permission and carries a fee.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"xinjiang-uyghur-autonomous-region\">Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region</h3>\n\n<p>There have been instances of violent unrest in Xinjiang, causing deaths. There have been allegations of the use of lethal force to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of being caught up in any unexpected demonstrations or outbreaks of violence. The Chinese authorities will increase the security presence in the area and tend to react quickly and harshly to these incidents. The Chinese authorities may restrict communications and travel to some areas of Xinjiang at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>There have been widespread arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detention in Xinjiang, mainly affecting the local population, particularly Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. You may be at increased risk if you\u2019re of Uyghur descent and/or have lived previously in Xinjiang; or if you appear to be Muslim.</p>\n\n<p>You should expect airport-style security measures, including passport and security checks, at entrances to public places such as shopping centres, markets and parks. You may need to inform the security forces of your phone number, have your photograph taken, or be questioned as to the nature of your travel. Related to reports of the use of forced labour in Xinjiang, there have been reports of due diligence auditors being detained and harassed.</p>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times, avoid all protests and large crowds, be vigilant and monitor media reports. Do not photograph or film protests, large crowds, security officials or installations, or anything of a military nature. Mosques and other religious sites are also considered \u201csensitive\u201d sites by the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You should be aware that the ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-safety\">Building safety</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-precautions\">Fire precautions\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Fire protection standards in Chinese accommodation are not always the same as in the UK. Check fire precautions including access to fire exits. Make sure your accommodation has a working fire alarm and regularly check that the fire exits aren\u2019t blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carbon-monoxide-poisoning\">Carbon monoxide poisoning</h3>\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm. There have been incidences of carbon monoxide poisoning and death due to incorrectly installed gas equipment. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.co-bealarmed.co.uk/how-to-stay-safe/\">\u2018Be Alarmed\u2019 campaign</a> gives practical advice on how to stay safe, and lists the symptoms to look out for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You need a Chinese driving licence to drive in China. You must also have valid insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Accidents are common in China due to the poor quality of roads, high volumes of traffic and generally low driving standards, so you should drive with caution. If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident, call the police. Do not move your vehicle until they arrive but make sure you and your passengers are in a safe place. In cases where there are injuries, you may be held liable for medical costs. You will also be held liable if you run over a pedestrian.</p>\n\n<p>There are harsh penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol, even at very low levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Mariners should avoid the disputed territory between China and other countries in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. There have also been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the area. See the Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org\">Information Sharing website</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>You will need to produce your passport to buy a ticket and again to board the train.</p>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are noted for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft from overnight trains is common.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>China is a one-party state. Though China is open to foreign visitors, you should be aware of political and cultural sensitivities.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. The Chinese authorities enforce public order strictly and you may face arrest, detention and/or deportation. Foreign journalists have been intimidated, assaulted or detained for trying to report demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>You may also risk becoming a target yourself when general anti-foreign sentiment runs high. Keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of the local authorities. During periods of tension, some news reporting, access to text-messaging, the internet and to international telephone lines may be blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Following protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there were reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong. This included reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices had been checked at border crossings.  You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.</p>\n",

Both \u2018national security\u2019 and \u2018national interest\u2019 appear regularly in Chinese legislation and have broad scope. You may be detained without having intended to break the law. Activity that occurred outside of mainland China \u2013 including online activity \u2013 could fall under scope of mainland legislation. There is a risk of arbitrary detention \u2013 including of British nationals.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on certain religious activities, including preaching and distributing religious materials. The Falun Gong movement is banned in China.</p>\n\n<p>Gambling is illegal in mainland China.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h2>\n<p>China does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you help. If you were born in China to a Chinese national parent you will be considered by the Chinese authorities to have Chinese nationality, and will be treated as a Chinese citizen, even if you used a British passport to enter China. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry clear evidence that you have done so. The FCDO has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-proceedings\">Criminal proceedings</h2>\n<p>Chinese laws and procedures relating to the arrest and detention of suspects of crime are different from in the UK. If you\u2019re suspected of a crime, the Chinese authorities have the power to prevent you from leaving China (by withholding your passport or applying a travel ban) or detaining you for up to 37 days without charge.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of an increasing number of foreign nationals subject to exit bans. Exit bans may be imposed on individuals involved in commercial or private disputes to prevent them from leaving mainland China. An exit ban can relate to investigations into an individual, their family or an employer, and can be used in criminal and civil matters, including business disputes.</p>\n\n<p>Exit bans are distinct from detention or imprisonment.\u00a0They are part of the Chinese legal process and can stay in place until resolution of the legal process in question. This means an exit ban may endure for months or years.\u00a0You may not be aware that you are subject to an exit ban until you try to leave mainland China. If you\u2019re detained on grounds of national security, which is interpreted more broadly than in the UK, you may be detained for up to 6 months before formal arrest and may be denied legal representation before charges are brought..</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h2>\n<p>There are extremely severe penalties for drugs offences in China, including the death penalty. The Chinese authorities undertake random drug testing on foreign nationals including on entry to the country. If you test positive, the Chinese authorities can prosecute you regardless of where or when you consumed drugs. Police raids on homes also occur; if drugs are found in your property, penalties can be extremely severe.</p>\n\n<p>There have been increasing incidences of police raids on nightclubs and bars. When such raids take place, patrons will be subject to on the spot drug testing and immigration checks. This may involve being kept at the location, or a secondary location, for several hours whilst hair and urine samples are taken and passport and visa checks conducted. Testing positive to drugs, or being found in breach of your visa conditions, can lead to heavy fines, detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cyber\">Cyber</h2>\n<p>The Chinese authorities maintain controls on internet access. Some services, including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are permanently blocked. Other websites may be blocked from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s cyber security laws are changing and online products and services (eg VPNs) need to be licensed by the Chinese government. More information is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.miit.gov.cn/\">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology website</a>  (in Mandarin only). Make sure you stay informed and follow Chinese law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT</h2>\n<p>Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention.

If you\u2019re unsure how China\u2019s entry requirements apply to you, you can contact the Chinese Embassy or one of its consulates in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals need a visa to enter mainland China,  including Hainan Island, but not Hong Kong or Macao. Separate Travel Advice for Hong Kong can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hong-kong\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All visa applicants aged between 14 and 70 inclusive need to make their visa application in person at a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.visaforchina.org/\">Visa Application Centre</a>. As part of the application process, biometric data (scanned fingerprints) has to be provided. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in London, Manchester and Edinburgh are operating and details of opening hours are on their respective websites. The Application Centre in Belfast remains closed.</p>\n\n<p>For further information on categories, and the process for submitting forms for those eligible, please visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/visa/notice/202304/t20230403_11053668.htm\">this page</a> on the Chinese Embassy website.</p>\n\n<p>Biometric data may be checked/collected by the immigration authorities when entering China to register your entry to the country.</p>\n\n<p>Since 8 January 2023, visa-free transit and transiting airside has resumed. All travellers entering into China must comply in full with entry requirements; there are no exemptions to this.</p>\n\n<p>If you visit Hong Kong from the mainland of China and wish to return to the mainland, you will need a visa that allows you to make a second entry into China.</p>\n\n<p>It is your responsibility to check your visa details carefully. Do not overstay your visa or work illegally. The authorities conduct regular checks and you may be fined, detained or deported (or all three).</p>\n\n<p>If you remain in China longer than 6 months, you may need to get a Residence Permit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19-entry-requirements\">COVID-19 Entry Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>From 30 August 2023, China has removed COVID-19 entry requirements and travellers into China are no longer required to undertake any testing before boarding flights. Travellers entering and exiting China are still required to complete the Health Declaration Form via the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://htdecl.chinaport.gov.cn/htdeclweb/home/pages/healthDeclare/declare.html\">China Customs website</a> or through the China Customs App, WeChat or Alipay account.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers entering China displaying symptoms of fever, or with an abnormal Health Declaration, may be asked to undertake a rapid antigen test on arrival. Those who test positive will be asked to wear a mask and may be advised to self-isolate whilst symptoms remain (although there is no mandatory self-isolation for COVID-19).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"children-and-young-people\">Children and young people</h2>\n\n<p>Children aged 5 and under are required to apply for a Customs Code Health Declaration Form.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transiting-through-a-third-country-to-arrive-in-china\">Transiting through a third country to arrive in China</h2>\n\n<p>Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.</p>\n\n<p>Transiting through a third country to China is permitted and you are no longer required to undertake a lateral flow/rapid antigen test. Those transiting should still complete the Health Declaration Form via the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://htdecl.chinaport.gov.cn/htdeclweb/home/pages/healthDeclare/declare.html\">China Customs website</a> or through the China Customs App, WeChat or Alipay account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-chinese-authorities\">Registering with the Chinese authorities</h2>\n<p>You must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau within 24 hours of arrival. Chinese authorities enforce this requirement with regular spot-checks of foreigners\u2019 documentation. If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, they will do this for you as part of the check-in process.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h2>\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"working-in-china\">Working in China</h2>\n<p>You can only work in China if you have a Z visa - tourist and business visit visas do not allow you to do so. You must also hold a valid work permit. The local police regularly carry out checks on companies/schools. Violation of Chinese immigration laws can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment, fines, deportation, a travel ban preventing you from leaving China, and an exclusion order, which prevents you from returning.</p>\n\n<p>Before you leave the UK you should contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/\">Chinese Embassy</a> to check visa requirements. When submitting your visa application, and when you receive your work permit, check that the details are correct, including the location you\u2019ll be working in. If they\u2019re not, you can be detained.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to change employer once you\u2019re in China, you should check with the Chinese authorities whether a new visa and work permit is needed before doing so.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"teaching-in-china\">Teaching in China</h2>\n<p>Teaching in China can be a rewarding experience, but before you travel it\u2019s important that you research thoroughly the school or university that is hiring you and are confident that they are following the law. There have been many incidents of teachers being detained and/or deported for working on the wrong visas. It is your responsibility to check you\u2019re working on the correct visa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-your-passport-and-travel-documents-before-you-travel\">Check your passport and travel documents before you travel</h2>\n\n<p>If you are visiting China, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.</p>\n",

Certain medicines may not be available and you <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/medicines-abroad/\">may be prohibited</a> from bringing others into the country. For more information and advice, check with your GP and the Embassy of China before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare is not free in China and can be very expensive.

Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for Beijing and other cities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/beijing/\">Air Quality Index website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tap water in China is generally not safe to drink. You should drink only bottled water.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of China, including Tibet, parts of Xinjiang and Qinghai Province. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities react quickly to any outbreaks of any infectious disease, including enforcing quarantine for those showing symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Human infections of avian influenza are being reported in China, particularly among those individuals who have been in close contact with infected birds. Before travelling, you should read more information and follow the prevention advice on <a href=\"/government/publications/avian-influenza-advice-for-travellers-to-china\">Public Health England</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Other_risks\">NaTHNaC\u2019s</a> websites.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/42/dengue\">Dengue fever</a> is present in some parts of China mainly during the rainy season.
