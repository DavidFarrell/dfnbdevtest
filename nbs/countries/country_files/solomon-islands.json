Political unrest can happen in Honiara during sittings of Parliament, elections and times of political uncertainty. Demonstrations can turn violent quickly. Avoid protests and political gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Security lockdowns can be announced at very short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor local media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force has limited resources and response times to calls for help can be slow. There have been reports of robberies involving violence, handbag snatching, pick-pocketing, distraction thefts and harassment, particularly around the central market and local beaches. There has been a recent increase in the number of house burglaries. Make sure you have effective security in place.</p>\n\n<p>Civil unrest and drunken behaviour can occur. Foreigners and expatriates may be attractive targets for violence. Take care if going to local nightclubs and be aware that such venues rarely have adequate fire precautions in place.</p>\n\n<p>Take sensible security precautions at all times, and maintain a high state of personal awareness. Be especially vigilant whilst travelling around Honiara at night particularly if on foot. Take particular care in the squatter settlements around Honiara, White River and the Lungga Bridge, Sun Valley, Mataniko Bridge, Burns Creek and Henderson (airport) area. Security incidents in these areas have included improvised road blocks, sporadic rock throwing and more serious violent criminal acts, including sexual assault, robbery and vehicle hijacking. If you plan to visit rural Guadalcanal, take day trips outside Honiara or visit the island of Malaita you should check local advice before travelling. Visits to other provinces in Solomon Islands are generally trouble-free.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are few roads in Solomon Islands; 90% of these are on Guadalcanal and Malaita. Many are heavily potholed and in some areas bridges have collapsed. Standards of driving and vehicle maintenance are poor. Be especially careful when overtaking. Many Solomon Islanders chew betel nut and frequently open vehicle doors, including on the driver\u2019s side, when travelling at speed, in order to spit onto the road. Take care when driving in and around town. Poor pedestrian discipline and speeding has resulted in a number of fatal accidents. Driving at night requires even more care as there is little street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a road accident the law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. There may however be circumstances where this is not safe, for example if a large and hostile crowd has gathered. In this case, it may be preferable to drive to the nearest police station to report the incident.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>International air travel routes have resumed but are infrequent and subject to change. From Friday 1 July 2022 domestic flights started to return to normal. When flights are in operation, reliability of services can be patchy and cancellations occur. Domestic flights are particularly prone to disruption and visitors with international connections should take note and plan accordingly. Facilities at Henderson International Airport are well below those at most international airports and you should prepare accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>Domestic ferries to/from Honiara are currently operating a reduced service.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid travel on inter-island ferries wherever possible. Ferry services are usually crowded and safety regulations are not always strictly applied. Some domestic inter-island passenger ferries are operated at a nationally acceptable standard, but most domestic shipping is operated at a standard that would not be acceptable to an international traveller, and few carry recognised insurance. You should check with the operator before embarking. Bring your own lifejacket if you are taking sea journeys. Journeys to small and/or remote islands are usually in small-motorised canoes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dangerous-wildlife\">Dangerous wildlife</h2>\n\n<p>Salt water crocodiles are native to many parts of Solomon Islands, and there are regular sightings on beaches. Take local advice before entering unfamiliar waters, including lakes. There are also large species of shark (such as bull, hammerhead and tiger sharks) in the coastal waters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports</h2>\n\n<p>Many visitors to Solomon Islands take part in water sports, including scuba diving and snorkelling without incident. However, deaths and serious accidents have occurred because basic safety measures weren\u2019t taken. Safety precautions and emergency responses may be less than those expected in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There is no decompression chamber in Honiara as the Hyberbaric chamber is currently out of service due to earthquake damage.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance policy covers you for the activities you take part in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexploded-ordinance\">Unexploded ordinance</h2>\n\n<p>The remnants of war are still present throughout Solomon Islands. The condition and stability of the weapons is unknown. You should get local advice before you travel to areas including Hell\u2019s Point, Honiara and surrounding ridges, the New Georgia group of islands, the former capital of Tulagi and the Russell Islands.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"communications\">Communications</h2>\n\n<p>There are two mobile telephone networks operating in Solomon Islands. Coverage is variable but does extend to the outer provinces and is becoming more extensive. Contact your service provider for further details. Your UK mobile phone is highly unlikely to work in the Solomon Islands. Local SIM cards and handsets are available. Solomon Telekom offers a hire service for satellite phones. Mobile 4G internet services are available in Honiara. Check with the operator for tariffs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pacific-games-2023\">Pacific Games 2023\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>The Pacific Games 2023, is a continental multi-sport event for Oceania countries, which will be hosted in Honiara from 19 November to 3 December. You should ensure you plan your travel carefully during this time as there is likely to be pressure on local infrastructure and resources due to an increased number of visitors. Confirm your travel plans in good time including your hotel accommodation. Traffic delays in Honiara are possible as road and transport arrangements are adjusted. There will be an increased security presence and you should take sensible precautions, monitor local media for any security changes and follow the guidance of local authorities.</p>\n",

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad.

You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h3>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are widespread across Solomon Islands. You should follow the advice of local authorities, National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Viral infections are common and you should take precautions to reduce the risks (ie washing hands and drinking bottled water).</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Solomon Islands as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/199/solomon-islands#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n<p>Medical facilities are very basic. There are limited hospital facilities and medical supplies aren\u2019t always available. The National Referral Hospital in Honiara frequently runs out of blood supplies and often has a very limited stock of oral re-hydration salts, paracetamol and basic antibiotics. Wards and units can close down at very short notice. Gizo hospital is newly built and has good facilities, but can also run short of supplies.</p>\n\n<p>Take a basic medical kit with you when visiting rural and remote areas. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. To receive medical treatment in Australia, you\u2019ll need a medical visa before you arrive in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",
