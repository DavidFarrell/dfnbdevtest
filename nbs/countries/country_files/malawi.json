Review your security systems and watch out for anything unusual.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>Since March 2020 there have been reports of possible incidents of unrest and violence in rural areas of Mulanje, linked to rumours of bloodsuckers. This is further to similar incidents of violence and unrest reported during the period September to December 2017 and July 2018 in the areas of Mulanje, Thyolo, Chiradzulu, Phalombe and also in rural parts of Blantyre, Zomba and Nsanje districts. You should continue to exercise extreme caution if you\u2019re travelling in these areas, especially after dark, avoid any demonstrations or large groups of people and follow local security advice.</p>\n\n<p>Seek security advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mcm.org.mw\">Mulanje Mountain Club</a> if you intend to climb Mulanje mountain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Spontaneous demonstrations related to governance and economic issues can occur. If you\u2019re in Malawi, avoid large crowds or demonstrations, monitor this travel advice and local media for updates and keep any local and international travel plans under review.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h3>\n<p>You can drive in Malawi using a UK driving licence for up to 90 days or an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/driving-abroad/idp\">International Driving Permit</a> for up to one year. You should carry a valid driving licence, a copy of your passport and your visa or residence permit at all times when driving, as you may need to produce these at police check points.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent fuel shortages in Malawi. Do not take accessibility of fuel for travel in the country for granted, and plan ahead accordingly to ensure that you can reach your planned destination. Where fuel is available, there can often be long queues.</p>\n\n<p>Slow down in all built-up areas. Traffic police often place speed cameras where there are no signs showing the speed limit. The police can impose on the spot fines.</p>\n\n<p>Driving in Malawi can be hazardous. Always wear a seatbelt and avoid travel after dark. Potholes, animals, abandoned vehicles and cyclists can cause serious accidents, as can vehicles travelling at night without lights.</p>\n\n<p>Malawi has a very high rate of fatalities on the road. Travel between towns by public minibus or pick-up truck isn\u2019t recommended; vehicles are often in poor condition and overloaded. Emergency services are basic. Larger coach services do run between the major towns and are more reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Lock car doors and keep windows closed. Armed carjacking is a risk, especially for drivers of four-by-four vehicles. Don\u2019t offer lifts to strangers and look out for obstructions in the road ahead.</p>\n\n<p>When driving, be very wary if another car signals you to pull over or blocks your progress.  In recent years there have been a small number of kidnapping incidents involving foreign nationals (including a British national in 2021) taken from their vehicles in Malawi by criminals.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<p>The Malawi Police Service has introduced breathalyser tests, and regularly stops vehicles for speeding. There are speed cameras on the main roads. Drivers caught drink driving or speeding can have their licences and vehicles confiscated on the spot. Convicted drivers face a fine and/or imprisonment. The blood alcohol limit is 0.08g per 100ml of blood (the same as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).</p>\n",

Some schools have been closed in Lilongwe and Blantyre.</p>\n\n<p>Outbreaks of gastric intestinal infections are also common. Whilst the majority of travellers are at low risk of disease, standard <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/44/food-and-water-hygiene\">food, water and personal hygiene</a> precautions should be observed.
