Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process</li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Georgian and\u00a0UK\u00a0laws before making any arrangements</li>\n  <li>read\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0and Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>\n</li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Georgia to the\u00a0UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need a Georgian birth certificate for this. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://psh.gov.ge/main/menus/1\">Public Service Hall</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sda.gov.ge/?page_id=7313&amp;lang=en\">Service Development Agency</a> websites and research the rules for leaving the country with children (some legal details are in Georgian only). You can stay visa-free in Georgia for a continuous period of up to one year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://new.geoconsul.gov.ge/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia</a> has more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trade-with-south-ossetia-and-abkhazia\">Trade with South Ossetia and Abkhazia</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia needs a licence issued by the Georgia government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Anyone trading without a licence may face penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> covers your activities.</p>\n\n<p>If you get into trouble during hiking, skiing, adventure travel or extreme sports, the emergency response may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is very dangerous. It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks. Read our information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">staying safe during skiing and winter sports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re trekking, mountaineering, climbing, off-piste skiing or doing other extreme sports, consider going with specialist guides. Many insurance policies will not cover damage to rental equipment or skiing off-piste without a guide.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that safety standards in Georgia may not be as high as those in the UK. For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to hike close to the administrative boundary lines, consider hiring a professional guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas.</p>\n\n<p>Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven. There may be occasional short power cuts \u2013 consider carrying a torch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly. To stay safe using taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not flag taxis in the street</li>\n  <li>try to pre-book taxis through an app</li>\n  <li>check the taxi has working seatbelts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Georgia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/georgia/\">RAC Georgia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Georgia with a UK driving licence for up to one year (from when you last entered Georgia). To drive for longer, you need a 1949 or 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dds.georgia.gov/drivers-other-nations\">Georgian driving licence</a>. If you\u2019re hiring a car, check the rules with the car hire company before you travel. They may require you to have an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>Drink driving punishments can be severe. Georgia has a lower blood alcohol content limit than the UK, so avoid alcohol if driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when driving, especially at night. Be aware that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>roads outside city centres are often badly lit and poor quality</li>\n  <li>stray livestock can be a hazard</li>\n  <li>road markings and the right of way can be confusing</li>\n  <li>many cars are poorly maintained</li>\n  <li>driving can be erratic</li>\n  <li>heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas)</li>\n  <li>landslides are common</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling outside Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is equipped and check weather conditions locally.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions with your personal safety and belongings. Compartments on sleeper trains usually have locks.</p>\n\n<p>There is currently no train service between Azerbaijan and Georgia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>There are frequent small earthquakes in Georgia. The most recent significant earthquake took place in 2022 \u2013 an earthquake measuring 6.2 struck 104km south-west of Tbilisi. Read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency advice on what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lightning and wildfires are a risk in summer, particularly in the mountains.</p>\n\n",

There are thousands of claims to property ownership from people displaced by conflicts following the collapse of the USSR.</p>\n\n<p>Buying these properties could have serious financial and legal implications, including legal proceedings in Georgia\u2019s courts and enforcement of court judgements elsewhere in Europe. If territorial disputes are settled, this could have consequences. For example, property may need to be returned to its original owners (property restitution).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-to-and-from-russia\">Travel to and from Russia</h2>\n\n<p>It is illegal under Georgian law to enter Georgia from Russia through South Ossetia or Abkhazia. If you do this, you could get heavy fines or a prison sentence of up to 4 years. If your passport has entry or exit stamps from the self-declared authorities in these regions, Georgian authorities may see this as illegal entry through an unrecognised border crossing.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering travelling to Russia through the land borders with Russia, check <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/russia\"><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s Russia travel advice</a>. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Russia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexploded-weapons-in-border-and-boundary-areas\">Unexploded weapons in border and boundary areas</h2>\n\n<p>There is some risk from unexploded weapons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>along the administrative boundary lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia</li>\n  <li>near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Areas where there might be unexploded weapons are not always marked.
