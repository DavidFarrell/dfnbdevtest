Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning.  Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (especially churches), national parks, businesses with western interests and foreign, national and local government facilities may also be targets of attack.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods and during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods. On 11 June 2022, over 100 people were killed following a terrorist attack in Seytenga in the Province of Seno. Further attacks are possible. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Westerners have been kidnapped and killed in Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region. There remains a high threat of kidnap in Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou, and the wider Sahel region. Two westerners have been kidnapped in 2022 alone. There\u2019s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks, including in Ouagadougou. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burkina-faso/terrorism#kidnap\">Kidnap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A state of emergency is currently in place in the following eight regions: Centre-Est, Est, Centre Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun, Sahel, Hauts-Bassins and Cascades. The measure gives security forces extra powers to conduct searches, restrict freedom of movement and detain persons of interest. Some civil rights may be suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large meetings. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Ouagadougou.</p>\n\n<p>Two military zones are currently in place in Soum in the north, and in the south-east on the border with Benin.

You should avoid all political rallies and gatherings, demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. Foreign, national and local government facilities have been targeted and damaged in previous demonstrations. You should monitor the local news to help you avoid such gatherings. If you become aware of a crowd gathering where you are, you should leave the area immediately.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of armed groups stopping vehicles (including public buses) on major roads to rob them, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>Street crime poses high risks for visitors. Most incidents involve opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active in crowded places. The areas near and around the UN Circle and the former Central Market in Ouagadougou experience a high amount of street crime. You should take sensible precautions.

The scams come in many forms such as romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims.</p>\n\n<p>You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel outside of Ouagadougou against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should take professional security advice and avoid travel between towns by road at night, particularly from Bobo Dioulasso to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Fada to Benin and Togo. There is a history of violent incidents in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents are not confined to principal routes. Secondary roads (notably roads in the east to Benin, Bogand\u00e9e and Gayeri) have also been affected.</p>\n\n<p>You should also take care if you\u2019re travelling by road between Burkina Faso and Niger. Travel in convoy where possible and seek local advice before setting out. Following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Burkina Faso.</p>\n\n<p>Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country, and the number of attacks has increased in recent years. Drivers who have refused to stop for robbers have been shot at. Remote and border regions are particularly vulnerable but there have been attacks on the main road between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Burkina Faso using a UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>With a few exceptions, roads are poor with few streetlights. There is a risk of banditry and hitting stray livestock. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season (June-September). Vehicles do not always have headlights and are often in poor condition. There is a history of violent incidents along roads in areas outside Ouagadougou.</p>\n\n<p>Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads in remote areas unless travelling in convoy. If you break down off a main road you may not be able to attract help. Carry drinking water with you.</p>\n\n",

Civilians found within them risk being mistaken for terrorists and caught up in military operations.</p>\n\n<p>Security mitigation is limited outside the capital Ouagadougou. There have been regular attacks on police, military personnel and civilians, particularly close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d\u2019Ivoire and in the Eastern Region.</p>\n\n<p>Notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 11 June 2022, over 100 people were killed following a terrorist attack in Seytenga in the province of Seno, close to the border with Niger.</li>\n  <li>On 4 to 5 June 2021, over 160 people were killed in an attack on the village of Solhan in north-eastern Burkina Faso.</li>\n  <li>On 26 April 2021, one Irish national and two Spanish nationals were killed in an ambush on the PK 60 road between Fada-N\u2019Gourma and Pama.</li>\n  <li>On 29 to 30 May 2020, around 50 people were killed in three separate attacks in the eastern Kompienga region, and in the northern provinces of Sanmatenga and Loroum.

Three suspected terrorists were killed, and 5 gendarmes and 1 civilian wounded. Weapons and bomb-making materials were found at the scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of kidnap is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups including Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) operate in the region. These groups rely on kidnapping for ransom to finance their activities and will continue to target foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about the threat from terrorism <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">in the Sahel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Recent kidnap incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In April 2022, a Polish national was kidnapped in north-eastern Burkina Faso and was released in June 2022. A US national was also kidnapped in Yalgo in the north-east and released in September 2022.</li>\n  <li>On 15 January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped near Gayeri in the Est region and found dead near the Niger border 2 days later.</li>\n  <li>In mid-December 2018, a Canadian and Italian were kidnapped in southwest Burkina Faso. They were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in north-east Mali after reportedly escaping.</li>\n  <li>In September 2018, 2 foreign nationals were kidnapped in the far north by an armed group.</li>\n  <li>In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, one of whom has since been released.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A number of hostages kidnapped in Burkina Faso are still being held by terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces such as places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",
