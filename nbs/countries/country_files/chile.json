You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Attacks, although unlikely, could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional acts of domestic terrorism by anarchist groups, mostly in Santiago, including the use of small explosive devices. Groups mainly target banks (ATMs) and public transport. Keep bags with you at all times, and report any suspicious behaviour or unattended packages to local authorities. Since early April 2020, there has been an increase in attacks against security forces in the Araucan\u00eda region, particularly around Ruta 5. You should exercise caution and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent protest in Santiago and other Chilean cities, particularly on Friday afternoons and evenings.</p>\n\n<p>Even peaceful protests can become violent. The largest protests usually take place in central Santiago. Police can use tear gas and water cannons against protesters.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all demonstrations. Under Chilean law, you can be deported if you\u2019re involved in or promote violent acts that could disturb social order or the system of government.</p>\n\n<p>Nationwide protests often take place on significant dates, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>11 September (anniversary of the military coup)</li>\n  <li>29 March (Day of the Young Combatant)</li>\n  <li>1 May (Workers\u2019 Day)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing and mugging are common in many cities throughout Chile.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Keep your valuables and passport somewhere secure, such as in a hotel safe. Bags hanging on chairs or mobile phones on tables can be targeted by thieves, who may use distraction techniques or work in pairs. Take particular care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>around tourist sites, and areas popular with tourists</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in cafes and restaurants</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>at transport hubs, including at the airport, bus stations and ports</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in hotel lobbies during arrival and departure</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When travelling by bus or coach, take care of your belongings when getting on and off. Keep your valuables with you, do not put them in storage compartments, especially for long journeys between regions. Be extremely wary of distractions at bus stations, where there are frequent thefts. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-theft-muggings\">Violent theft (muggings)</h3>\n\n<p>Muggings have happened in tourist areas in Santiago and Valparaiso, increasingly with weapons such as pistols and knives. Muggings can take place during the day and in plain sight of others. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly in tourist areas or near official buildings. Muggers will target:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tourists</li>\n  <li>people carrying large\u00a0amounts of money  \u2013 leaving ATMs or currency exchanges, for example</li>\n  <li>your passport (carrying a photocopy is enough)</li>\n  <li>valuable watches or jewellery</li>\n  <li>your mobile phone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not resist any attempted mugging.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in criminals:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>targeting rental cars in major cities \u2013 they sometimes puncture the car\u2019s tyres, often\u00a0while at traffic lights, distract the occupants when they notice the tyres and steal valuables</li>\n  <li>following people from the airport on arrival and robbing them, sometimes at gunpoint</li>\n  <li>targeting vehicles entering or leaving private residences while the gates are opening or closing</li>\n  <li>carrying out carjackings in Santiago, especially in affluent areas \u2013 some armed carjackers target high-end vehicles on highways</li>\n  <li>intercepting car locking systems when drivers remotely activate the lock</li>\n  <li>targeting people parked at viewpoints and stealing belongings from their cars</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings in and around the airport, when driving and on arrival at your destination. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed. Wait for gates to fully close before leaving your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance. If you\u2019re carjacked, local authorities say it is best to raise your hands and get out of the vehicle to avoid violence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxi-robberies\">Taxi robberies</h3>\n\n<p>People have been robbed by bogus and unlicensed taxi drivers, including in airport taxis. Use official or pre-booked taxis and ask taxi drivers for proof of the reservation \u2013 see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mtt.gob.cl/viaja-seguro-en-taxis.html\">how to recognise official taxis</a>\u00a0(in Spanish). At the airport there is a taxi office where you can book and pay in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Book taxis in advance rather than hailing one from the street, especially late at night. Keep in groups and avoid walking alone late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>People have been given \u2018spiked\u2019 drinks in nightclubs and bars, particularly in the Suecia and Bellavista areas of Santiago. These incidents leave victims open to theft or assault. Keep your drinks in sight and be wary of people offering to buy drinks for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry a photocopy of the photo page of your passport with you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to drink alcohol in public places including streets, roads, squares and promenades.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Using or possessing drugs is illegal and can lead to prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Chile and are increasingly widely accepted socially, although much of Chilean society is conservative.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fires-in-national-parks\">Fires in national parks</h3>\n\n<p>Open fires are illegal in national parks in Chile, outside permitted camping areas. Local authorities may revoke your tourist permit if you\u2019re caught starting a fire in a Chilean national park. You may be asked to leave the country voluntarily within 72 hours or face deportation. If your open fire starts a larger forest fire, you may also face criminal penalties and fines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to go exploring or mountaineering, tell the local authorities before you set off. For further information on mountaineering, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://feach.cl/contacto/\">Federaci\u00f3n de Andinismo de Chile</a>. For any other type of exploring, contact the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.chile.gob.cl/en/reino-unido/en\">Chilean Embassy in London</a> to see if you need a permit. The rescue services in Chile are good, but you may have to pay if they help you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Chile for 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You must have your passport and proof of your tourist status, such as your tourist card (\u2018tarjeta de turismo\u2019) or the entry stamp in your passport, with you in the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.transporteinforma.cl/atencion-de-usuarios/preguntas-frecuentes/preguntas-licencias-de-conducir/\">information about driving licences in Chile</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a car, get appropriate insurance. Windscreen repair can be expensive, so consider including windscreen damage cover.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get car insurance if you\u2019re driving on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). If you have an accident or do any damage to your vehicle there, you\u2019ll have to pay for the repairs yourself.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Main roads in Chile are surfaced, but you may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle in the countryside. Be prepared for a range of driving conditions, from snow and ice to hot sandy deserts. Between June and September, winter weather sometimes temporarily closes the Chile-Argentina border crossing high in the Andes, including the main Los Libertadores crossing between Santiago and Mendoza.</p>\n\n<p>Toll roads are increasingly common.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>Landmine accidents mainly affect livestock and local people crossing borders at unauthorised points. Most minefields are near the borders with Peru and Bolivia in the extreme north of Chile (regions XV, I and II) and Argentina in the south (region XII). Although most minefields are clearly marked, some signs and fences are old and damaged and may be hard to spot. In some cases, minefields are laid right up to the edge of highways. Check with local authorities before travelling to more rural areas, stick to clearly marked roads and observe all warning signs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Chile often has severe forest fires. These can be very destructive and spread rapidly, closing national parks and roads. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. Avoid areas they advise are at risk and follow evacuation procedures if instructed to by authorities.</p>\n\n<p>For up-to-date information about forest fires, check the:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://senapred.cl/informate/alertas\">Chilean National Emergencies alerts</a> (in Spanish)</li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.conaf.cl/situacion-nacional-de-incendios-forestales/\">Agriculture Ministry\u2019s summary of forest fires</a> (in Spanish)</li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:today;@0.0,0.0,3.0z\">NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Major earthquakes\u00a0are a risk in Chile. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>. Take note of instructions in hotel rooms.</p>\n\n<p>Building regulations require new structures to take account of earthquake risks. Safety measures are widely known and put into practice by national organisations and the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>A chain of volcanoes is active in the Puyehue and Los Lagos region (500 miles south of Santiago). There is a continuing risk of eruptions in Chaiten in southern Chile, Llaima in the Conguillo National Park and Lascar in northern Chile.\u00a0Copahue, a volcano on the Argentina-Chile border, erupts periodically, causing local residents to be evacuated. Villarrica, a volcano near the popular tourist destinations of Pucon and Villarrica in the IX region of La Araucan\u00eda, is also active.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to these areas, monitor local media reports and follow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sernageomin.cl/\">local authority volcano monitoring advice</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n",
