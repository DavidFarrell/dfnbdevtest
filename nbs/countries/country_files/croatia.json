Intentionally causing a fire is illegal in Croatia and you could be fined from approximately 2,000 to 20,000 euros, or even imprisoned.</p>\n\n<p>You can also be fined for unintentionally causing a fire. Properly extinguish cigarette ends and do not leave any rubbish behind, particularly empty bottles, as these are known to start fires. Fines in these cases have ranged from 260 to 1,200 euros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes in Croatia can be strong and cause deaths and damage to infrastructure. In recent years, there have been earthquakes in Zagreb and in Petrinja, near Sisak in central Croatia. Both caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and 8 people died. Heavily damaged buildings, which are not always signposted, may be unstable.</p>\n\n<p>There are small tremors several times a month throughout the year. Most pass without consequences.
