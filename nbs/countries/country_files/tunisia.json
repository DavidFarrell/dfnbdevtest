Further disturbances could occur with little or no warning and impact other Black people perceived to be of sub-Saharan African origin.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. There have been a number of self-initiated attacks in 2023. On 3 July a National Guard officer was attacked with a knife in the La Goulette area of Tunis.</p>\n\n<p>In June, a police officer was stabbed and killed outside the Brazilian Embassy in Tunis. In May, a fatal shooting took place on the island of Djerba, near to where Tunisian and international visitors were taking part in the annual Jewish pilgrimage at the El Ghriba synagogue. Three security personnel and two civilians were killed, and ten people were injured.</p>\n\n<p>Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one.

They usually take place in central areas of Tunis and other major cities, and in the vicinity of government buildings, often but not always on weekends or around prominent national anniversary dates. In response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, peaceful demonstrations have occurred in some Tunisian cities, including outside some Western embassies. Avoid all protests, and move away from gathered crowds.

It has been extended a number of times, most recently in February 2022. The state of emergency means that there continues to be a heightened countrywide security presence, including security checkpoints in and around some cities and tourists resorts, as well as on main roads and at borders.</p>\n\n<p>President Kais Saied ratified a new constitution in 2022, following the suspension of parliament in 2021 and its dissolution in 2022.

They can sometimes become violent. Larger demonstrations and protests usually take place in central areas of Tunis and other major cities, and in the vicinity of government buildings. Demonstrations can be called at short notice, and are often at weekends. There are certain prominent national dates on which demonstrations traditionally occur. In response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, peaceful demonstrations have occurred in some Tunisian cities, including outside some Western embassies.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid demonstrations and protests wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent. If you do find yourself unexpectedly near a demonstration or protest, move away from the area.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep up to date with developments through the media and follow the instructions given by the Tunisian authorities as well as your hotel and tour operator, if you have one.</p>\n\n<p>Strikes take place in Tunisia periodically, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders.</p>\n\n<p>Curfews can be imposed at short notice in response to events. You should follow the guidance of local authorities when travelling around the country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>You should check the latest guidance of local authorities and subscribe to the Travel Advice updates before moving around the country, to be aware of local events taking place and how that might impact your internal travel.</p>\n\n<p>Mobile phone coverage can be patchy or unavailable in more remote areas, particularly in the south of Tunisia.

Security personnel have been killed and severely wounded in attacks and by booby-trap explosives in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Incidents of mugging, pick pocketing, bag-snatching and petty theft occur. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Where possible, avoid carrying all your important documents, money and other valuables in the same bag. You should remain alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks are rare but they do occur.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several recent reports of assaults and theft in Tunis. \n Harassment of foreign women in Tunis is also reported to have increased.  These have occurred in a variety of areas, including busy public places at night, and quieter public parks and beaches during the daytime.</p>\n\n<p>You are advised to maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK and take care when walking or travelling alone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-screenings\">Security screenings</h2>\n\n<p>Some British nationals of South Asian descent have been subject to additional screening or refused entry by immigration authorities at airports, including Enfidha, on alleged security grounds. See entry requirements for further details.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discrimination-and-harassment\">Discrimination and harassment</h2>\n\n<p>Though not commonly experienced by visitors, racial discrimination may be an issue, particularly in public places. Following public comments on irregular migration in February 2023, there was a temporary spike in verbal and physical assaults against those thought to be sub-Saharan African migrants. There have also been recent anti-migrant protests in certain coastal towns, including Sfax.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Tunisia with a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year. You will need to have a 1968 IDP to drive in Tunisia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Tunisia. You can only get IDPs over the counter from UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Tunisia, it may be possible to drive on a UK licence for up to one year, providing that you meet a number of conditions and submit an application to the Tunisian Ministry of Transport. Please check the conditions and application process with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.attt.com.tn/page.php?code_menu=39\">Tunisian Ministry of Transport</a>. For any longer periods, you will need to apply for a Tunisian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Tunisia.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards can be erratic. There is very little lane discipline and often confusion about the right of way, especially at roundabouts. There are few pedestrian crossings and traffic lights are sometimes ignored. Take care when driving in towns as pedestrians tend to walk on the roads and have the right of way. Take particular care when crossing roads on foot, even where there is a signal allowing you to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Roads are of a reasonable standard although large potholes can appear quickly following heavy rain, and most towns and villages have large speed bumps.</p>\n\n<p>Driving at night can be hazardous particularly out of towns due to a lack of road lighting, unlighted vehicles, and animals on the roads in rural areas. Exercise caution and slow down when approaching sand drifts on roads.</p>\n\n<p>You may come across military or police security checks. If you do, approach slowly, don\u2019t cross boundaries without permission and be prepared to present photo ID if asked.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations can occasionally affect road travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should check the availability of fuelling stations before travelling long distances in remote areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Rail travel is generally safe, although safety standards tend to be lower than those in the UK. There is a risk of petty crime on trains.</p>\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">terrorism</a>\u00a0while abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Libya-based extremists with links to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). Despite some improvements in border security, Tunisia has a porous border with Libya, where there is a continuing conflict, an absence of security, and where Islamist terrorist groups operate. Tunisian security forces have repeatedly been targeted in terrorist-related incidents, mainly in border areas including in the Chaambi Mountains.</p>\n\n<p>A nationwide state of emergency, first imposed after a suicide attack on a police bus in November 2015, remains in place. Follow the advice of local security officials, including in and around religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces\u2019 response times to an incident may vary.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation interests. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Tunisia to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>The Tunisian authorities regularly report that they have disrupted planned attacks and terrorist cells and made arrests. The Tunisian authorities have improved security in tourist resorts and their ability to respond to a terrorist incident. Tunisian security forces have also improved and are better prepared to tackle terrorist threats than they were at the time of the 2015 attacks. But further attacks remain likely, including in places visited by foreigners such as tourist resorts. Attacks may be carried out by individuals unknown to the authorities, whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups.  There have been a number of self-initiated attacks in recent months.</p>\n\n<p>Recent incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 3 July a National Guard officer was stabbed in a knife attack in the Goulette area of Tunis.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in May 2023, a fatal shooting took place on the island of Djerba, near where Tunisian and international visitors were taking part in the annual Jewish pilgrimage at the El Ghriba synagogue. Three security personnel and two civilians were killed, and ten people were injured.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2022, two security officers were injured in a knife attack by an assailant near a synagogue in central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in January 2022, January three passengers on a tram at Bab Alioua station in Tunis were injured after a knife attack.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in November 2021, police shot and wounded an assailant who attacked them with a knife and axe in front of the Interior Ministry on Habib Bourguiba avenue, central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in September 2020, two officers of Tunisia\u2019s National Guard were attacked by three assailants in Sousse. Security forces later killed all three attackers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in March 2020, a suicide bombing targeting a police patrol near the US Embassy in Tunis killed one police officer and injured four more, as well as a civilian.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in October 2019, a French national was stabbed to death in Zarzouna, northern Tunisia, by an individual who then attacked a Tunisian soldier.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2019, there were 2 suicide bombings targeting security personnel in central Tunis; 3 people, including the perpetrators, were killed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in October 2018, 15 security personnel and 5 civilians were injured in a bombing on Avenue Habib Bourguiba in central Tunis.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in July 2018, militants attacked security forces near Ghardimaou, close to the Algerian border. A number of Tunisian National Guard officers were killed. This follows separate media reports in early July 2018 of Tunisian security forces disrupting a terrorist group in Hammamet.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in June 2015, 38 foreign tourists were killed, including 30 British nationals, in a terrorist attack at Port El Kantaoui near Sousse.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>in March 2015, 21 tourists were killed, including a British national, in a terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum in the centre of Tunis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",
