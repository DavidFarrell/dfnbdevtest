Belarusian authorities launched a violent crackdown against demonstrators across Belarus after the 2020 presidential elections and is currently a repressive environment.  You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stay vigilant</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds</li>\n  <li>if protests break out, leave the area immediately</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is often a heightened security forces presence on the streets of Minsk and other major cities.

Make sure you carry your passport or a photocopy of the photo page of your passport, and visa if you have one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"russian-military-operations\">Russian military operations</h2>\n\n<p>The Belarusian authorities are facilitating Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.

If conflict takes place, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s ability to offer consular assistance may be limited.

Do not take photographs of security forces\u2019 activity (including police and military), and establishments or sites of strategic importance, including government buildings and critical infrastructure. This is illegal. There may not be warning signs in locations where prohibitions are in place.

Customs and immigration can be lengthy and bureaucratic. Ignore any private facilitators who offer to help you pass through checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>You must be able to produce original vehicle ownership documents at border crossings.

If you do, your vehicle could be confiscated at the border or at an in-country police checkpoint.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"polish-border\">Polish border</h2>\n\n<p>The situation close to the Polish border is unpredictable. Border crossings may close or implement restrictions at short notice. You should check this before any travel across the border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lithuania-border\">Lithuania border</h2>\n\n<p>In August 2023, Lithuanian authorities closed two border crossing points with Belarus.

Stop when instructed and have vehicle documentation available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>The quality of driving in Belarus is unpredictable. A-class highways are in good condition. The condition of B-class roads varies. Some are impassable for periods in winter.

The EU has closed its airspace to Belarusian registered aircraft and has sanctioned Belavia the Belarusian state owned carrier.</p>\n\n<p>The UK has sanctioned the Belarusian air traffic control operator.\u00a0 Due to international restrictions on Belavia, they may not have access to components which are needed for the safe maintenance of their aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>HMG staff do not use Belavia.</p>\n\n<p>The UK has placed sanctions on some Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural. It is illegal for any British national or company in the UK to do business with these airlines, including buying airline tickets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are frequent standard security checks at some stations on the Minsk Metro. Transport police may ask to scan your bags. You must comply with this. You could be arrested if you refuse.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pedestrians\">Pedestrians</h3>\n\n<p>You could be fined for jaywalking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"chernobyl-site\">Chernobyl site</h2>\n\n<p>There\u2019s an exclusion zone immediately around the Chernobyl site. This includes the area close to the border with Ukraine in the south east of Belarus. Access to this part of the country is limited. The risk of radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl site is insignificant elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"drugs\">Drugs</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug-related crime. These include prison sentences of up to 5 years for drug possession and up to 25 years for more serious drug-related offences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexual relationships are legal in Belarus. However, Belarus is still a conservative society and the LGBT+ scene is very low profile. Very few LGBT+ people are open about their sexuality. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking photographs of all government buildings, military installations and uniformed officials. You will be asked to delete photos and there may be other penalties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-goods-for-charitable-purposes\">Importing goods for charitable purposes</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to import goods or services for charitable purposes, consult the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/\">Embassy of Belarus in the UK</a> for advice about local procedures and tariffs. If you think your goods will be exempt from Belarusian taxation, get written confirmation from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/\">Embassy of Belarus in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Belarus. Because of potential security challenges linked to Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, we advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements in Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national with current surrogacy arrangements in Belarus, contact <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on 01908 516 666 if you have not already done so.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have surrogacy arrangements in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>You may wish to ask your surrogacy agency about the safest location where all parties to the surrogacy arrangement can stay. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot facilitate evacuation.</li>\n  <li>In many cases, Belarusian law requires that the surrogate is married. This could affect British nationality for a child born under such a surrogacy arrangement. You should seek specialist UK legal advice about nationality determinations, Parental Orders and what you need for travel documents.</li>\n  <li>Seek in-country legal advice. This is important for issues like legalising UK documents, notarising Belarusian documents, document processing and the maximum period of stay the authorities will allow. Due to the security challenges, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot confirm which lawyers are currently offering services. The surrogacy process in Belarus can be lengthy and complicated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement in another country, read the guidance for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-guidance-for-intended-parents-pre-surrogacy-pre-birth-and-post-birth/guide-3-for-intended-parents-return-to-the-uk\">intended parents planning for international surrogacy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-foreign-credit-and-debit-cards\">Using foreign credit and debit cards</h3>\n\n<p>There are plenty of ATMs in major cities. However, there are currently problems withdrawing cash using foreign credit and debit cards. Almost all major banks in Belarus do not accept foreign-issued cards. Those banks that do may charge a higher commission.</p>\n\n<p>There is also limited cash available. Many ATMs have limits on the amount of cash you can withdraw, particularly for foreign cards. Not all cards will be accepted in Belarus. Many reputable international money transfer providers have suspended operations in Belarus. Consider having cash in US dollars or euros if you decide to visit Belarus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sanctions\">Sanctions</h3>\n\n<p>The UK government has imposed sanctions against a range of Belarusian companies and individuals. These may impact on financial transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"exchanging-currency\">Exchanging currency</h3>\n\n<p>It can be difficult to exchange British pounds for Belarusian roubles. US dollars and Euros are more widely accepted. You may be asked to present your passport at a foreign currency exchange. Use government-licensed booths to exchange currency. You can find these in or near major stores, hotels and banks. If you exchange money elsewhere, you could be fined or arrested and the currency will be confiscated. You cannot exchange Belarusian roubles into other currencies outside Belarus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bank-services\">Bank services</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to Belarus, speak to your UK bank before you go. Because of sanctions against Belarus, your bank may block your card if you use it in Belarus. Many banks have suspended their services in Belarus, so please check with your provider.</p>\n\n",
