Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorists may target places visited by larger groups, including foreigners, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>restaurants, hotels, bars and markets</li>\n  <li>stations and airports</li>\n  <li>places of worship and tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>festivals, sports venues and beaches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stay alert, especially in public places</li>\n  <li>check local media for warnings before you travel</li>\n  <li>report unattended baggage quickly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Republic Day (26 January)</li>\n  <li>Independence Day (15 August)</li>\n  <li>Diwali (usually in October or November)</li>\n  <li>Eid (date changes each year)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Terrorist and insurgent groups include Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) and Naxalite groups. Media reports suggest Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and other groups may also be planning attacks. Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has also previously targeted India.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"regions-with-heightened-risk\">Regions with heightened risk</h4>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jammu and Kashmir, and less often in some parts of north-east India</li>\n  <li>rural areas of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha</li>\n  <li>parts of Bihar and West Bengal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/india/regional-risks\">regional risks for more information</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Strikes (sometimes referred to as \u2018bandh\u2019 or \u2018hartal\u2019), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company</li>\n  <li>monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.</p>\n\n<p>India\u2019s Women Helpline Number is 1091.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.</p>\n\n<p>Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad.\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.</p>\n\n<p>It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.</p>\n\n<p>In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.</p>\n\n<p>There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.</p>\n\n<p>The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bihar</li>\n  <li>Gujarat</li>\n  <li>Mizoram</li>\n  <li>Nagaland</li>\n  <li>the region of Lakshadweep</li>\n  <li>Manipur</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.</p>\n\n<p>E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking-in-india\">Trekking in India</h3>\n\n<p>Trekkers should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in groups</li>\n  <li>use reputable local guides and stay on established routes</li>\n  <li>check if you need any special permits</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Leave details of where you\u2019re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation.

In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.</p>\n\n<p>Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-custody-and-family-law\">Child custody and family law</h3>\n\n<p>Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers\">consult a local lawyer</a> to find out more about the relevant laws.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you\u2019re caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-offences-against-children\">Sexual offences against children</h3>\n\n<p>The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-in-india\">Transport risks in India</h2>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-rickshaws\">Taxis and rickshaws</h3>\n\n<p>When using taxis or rickshaws:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night</li>\n  <li>use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola are also widely available in India</li>\n  <li>if you\u2019re being collected at the airport by a hotel driver, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off</li>\n  <li>if you book a taxi online, there\u2019s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"cars-and-motorbikes\">Cars and motorbikes</h3>\n\n<p>Road accidents including car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic hazards include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reckless driving and manoeuvring</li>\n  <li>poorly maintained vehicles</li>\n  <li>poor quality and congested roads</li>\n  <li>roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock</li>\n  <li>vehicles running red lights</li>\n  <li>protests - see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security#political-situation\">our advice on the Political Situation</a> in India</li>\n  <li>extreme weather and natural disasters - see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security#extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">our advice on Extreme weather</a> in India</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-in-india\">Driving in India</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in India, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit</a> after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.</p>\n\n<p>Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.</p>\n\n<p>Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks.\u00a0 Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling by train:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not accept food or drinks from strangers</li>\n  <li>thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables</li>\n  <li>avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Although piracy has not so far affected India\u2019s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.</p>\n\n<p>Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.</p>\n\n<p>Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster.\u00a0 Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.

There is a continuing threat, mainly towards Government of India targets.</p>\n\n<p>There have been violent protests and operations by security forces in the Kashmir Valley, which resulted in a number of deaths and serious casualties. There is a heavy security presence. Curfews and other restrictions can be imposed and lifted frequently and quickly. Stay vigilant, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners are vulnerable in rural districts and outside the main population centres and tourist areas. There is a risk of unpredictable violence, including bombings, grenade attacks, shootings and kidnapping. The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The level of consular assistance that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-new-delhi\">British High Commission in India</a> can provide in Jammu and Kashmir is severely limited.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-northern-states\">Other northern states</h2>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>FCDO advises against all travel within the vicinity of the India-Pakistan border, except for at Wagah where travellers can cross the border.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security#trekking-in-india\">FCDO advice if you are trekking in India.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"north-east-india\">North-east India</h2>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Manipur.</p>\n\n<p>In April-May 2023 violent ethnic clashes broke out across Manipur, including in the state capital Imphal. Curfews and other restrictions have been imposed in many parts of the state. There may be transport disruptions. Mobile internet services remain suspended.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid protests or large gatherings</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company</li>\n  <li>monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you decide that it is essential to travel to Imphal and the surrounding Imphal Valley areas, then only travel by air after checking the latest security conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of terrorism and organised crime in Manipur, especially in rural areas. Although foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can be indiscriminate.</p>\n\n<p>Some insurgent groups are active in north-east India. During 2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>violent clashes along the disputed border between Assam and Mizoram led to deaths</li>\n  <li>violent communal and political clashes were reported in Tripura</li>\n  <li>a number of civilians were killed by security forces in Nagaland near the Myanmar border</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been skirmishes on the India-Bangladesh border. Travellers are advised to check with local authorities before visiting these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and large gatherings are common in India\u2019s north-eastern states. They can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder. Avoid protests and leave as soon as possible if a crowd develops. Review your security arrangements carefully and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Permits from the Government of India are needed for travel to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sikkimtourism.gov.in/Public/index\">Sikkim</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.arunachaltourism.com/\">Arunachal Pradesh</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tourism.nagaland.gov.in/.\">Nagaland</a> and parts of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.andamans.gov.in/\">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>. Apply at least 3 months in advance. In India, apply at the liaison office of the state for which you need a permit or the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Permits for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands can be issued on arrival in Port Blair but this is not the case for the other states. Permit regulations can change at any time. Contact the relevant state liaison office or the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://boi.gov.in/\">Indian Bureau of Immigration</a> for the latest guidance.</p>\n\n<p>For travelling to Mizoram, you need to register online with the Superintendent of Police in Aizawl or state CID at e-FRRO online portal. If you decide that it is essential to travel to Manipur, you will need to inform the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) office in Imphal Manipur of your arrival in the state by road or the Immigration counter at the Imphal airport if flying into the state.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling to Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland you are advised to check guidelines issued by local authorities \u2013 you should do the same if you decide that it is essential to travel to Manipur. This is because traffic along the National Highways connecting them with each other and with Assam may be disrupted due to blockades and protests, particularly in border areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"east-india\">East India</h2>\n\n<p>Maoist (or Naxalite) insurgents target police officers, paramilitary forces and government officials. This caused several deaths and injuries in 2019. The Government of India has identified 25 districts as worst affected, 21 of which are in East India.</p>\n\n<p>Get advice from your travel provider and local authorities if you plan to travel to rural areas of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Gaya, Jamui or Lakhisarai (Bihar) - there is risk of violent crime in the rural areas of Bihar</li>\n  <li>Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Narayanpur, Rajnandgaon, Sukma (Chhattisgarh)</li>\n  <li>Chatra, Giridih, Gumla, Khunti, Latehar, Lohardaga, West Singhbhum, Saraikela-Kharaswan (Jharkhand) - there is risk of violent crime in the rural areas of Jharkhand</li>\n  <li>Kandhamal, Kalahandi or Malkangiri (Odisha) - foreign tourists and researchers must keep to security guidelines during visits to tribal areas in Odisha</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"western-region\">Western region</h2>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>FCDO advises against all travel within the vicinity of the India-Pakistan border, except for at Wagah where travellers can cross the border.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The India-Pakistan border in Gujarat and Rajasthan is unmarked in some areas. Approaching it away from an official crossing point could be dangerous. Where it is unmarked, you could stray into Pakistan illegally.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"goa\">Goa</h2>\n\n<p>Most British nationals visiting Goa do so without problems. However, because of the high number of tourists there are many opportunistic criminals operating in the region.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some serious incidents involving British nationals in recent years, including sexual assaults and the murder of a young female traveller.</p>\n\n<p>It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places in Goa. If you drink alcohol outside the limits of a place licensed to serve it, you could be fined or imprisoned.
