Be vigilant at all times, tell family and friends about your travel plans and carefully consider your movements\u00a0in advance, taking the safest routes available.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation is unpredictable and crime levels are high. There is usually an increase in crime leading up to the:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>holiday season in December</li>\n  <li>Carnival (in February or March)</li>\n  <li>beginning of the school year (late August/early September)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-and-gang-activity\">Criminal and gang activity</h3>\n\n<p>Theft, including armed robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing, is common in Haiti. Criminal and gang activity is especially common in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bel Air</li>\n  <li>Carrefour</li>\n  <li>Cit\u00e9 Soleil</li>\n  <li>downtown Port-au-Prince</li>\n  <li>Martissant</li>\n  <li>Petion-Ville</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People using cash machines have been targeted by criminals. Gangs, often on motorbikes, target people making withdrawals or leaving banks, particularly those travelling on foot. Take care when withdrawing money at public ATMs and use supermarkets or hotels with security guards. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Armed robbery is common. Victims are often attacked in the daytime by armed thieves on motorcycles. Some attacks have resulted in fatalities. Single women drivers in traffic have been targeted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnappings\">Criminal kidnappings</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of criminal kidnaps in Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal groups may target whole communities or individuals, including children. Missionary and humanitarian aid workers are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Most victims have been released after the payment of a ransom. In some exceptional cases, however, victims have disappeared or been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the threat of kidnap and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting. Be vigilant across the country, remaining alert to small groups, especially near where you\u2019re staying.</p>\n\n<p>Keep doors and windows secure at all times and be wary of inviting anyone into your residence who you do not know or were not expecting. Security guards are recommended at residential properties.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"haiti-dominican-republic-border\">Haiti-Dominican Republic border</h2>\n\n<p>The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is closed, however the Dominican government announced the reopening of air travel between Haiti and the Dominican Republic on 30 October.

Convicted offenders can expect lengthy legal proceedings, jail sentences and fines.</p>\n\n<p>Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry items through customs for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re caught in possession of drugs or suspected of drug trafficking, you may be arrested and jailed for weeks or months before appearing in court. Prison conditions in Haiti are very poor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You should always carry proof of your identity. Keep a copy of the photo page of your passport and visa stamp separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Local attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. In Haiti, same-sex sexual activity is legal. However, the attitude of many Haitians to the LGBT+ community is hostile.</p>\n\n<p>LGBT+ travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted and negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>It is uncommon for opposite or same-sex couples to show affection in public.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous.

During this period, tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes. Monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a> and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>\u00a0for information about how to prepare, and what to do if there is a warning of a hurricane.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in Haiti.
