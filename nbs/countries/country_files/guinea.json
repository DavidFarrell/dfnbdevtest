You can get International Driving Permits over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an International Driving Permit outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel is hazardous especially during the rainy season from May to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season. Avoid travel outside cities after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained, and the drivers often unqualified. Few motorists have any form of insurance. Most major hotels and travel agencies offer cars for hire, with a chauffeur if required.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of road maintenance is low. Beware of deep potholes. Many roads are not metalled and are not repaired after the rainy season. Roads within Conakry and other principal towns can quickly become flooded and impassable.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Supplies of fuel may run low from time to time; it is worth considering carrying an emergency stock, especially when making a long journey.</p>\n\n<p>Police and local militia maintain checkpoints across the country. Vehicles and passengers are submitted to checks on documentation and baggage. Corruption and extortion are common at roadblocks. Occasionally, checkpoints can be a pretext for armed robbery.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers are advised to exercise caution and be prepared for disruption and potential short notice closure of the Guinea-Sierra Leone border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.</p>\n\n<p>Flights in Guinea are frequently delayed or cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark, you should arrange your airport transfer before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Corruption at the airport by officials is common.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of attacks of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Guinean territorial waters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Conakry can only provide limited emergency consular assistance.
