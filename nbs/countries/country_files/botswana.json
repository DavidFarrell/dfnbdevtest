House burglaries, often by armed gangs, are common. Hold-ups and robberies of restaurants during peak hours have also occurred in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Theft from parked cars does occur and thieves target cars waiting at traffic lights to smash and grab handbags, phones or laptops. Keep valuables out of sight and in a safe place. If you\u2019re attacked, do not resist. Use a hotel safe, where practical. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place.</p>\n\n<p>There have been isolated room break-ins and robbery from lodges in the Chobe area, particularly river-fronting lodges. Lock your room when you can and secure valuables.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidences of rape and other sexual offences. Seek immediate medical advice if you\u2019re sexually assaulted or otherwise injured. Women, in particular, should not walk alone at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>You should avoid large demonstrations and gatherings. In 2011 police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Game reserves and other tourist areas are generally secure, but be alert to unpredictable behaviour by wild animals. Follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice. Avoid bathing in rivers and lakes, because of the dangers from both wildlife and water-borne diseases.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to remote areas plan your trip carefully, make transport and accommodation arrangements in advance and seek local security advice. Take emergency supplies (including water and fuel) and be prepared for off-road driving conditions. In very remote areas travel in convoy or with a satellite phone in case of breakdown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive using an\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit</a>\u00a0for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer you should apply for a Botswana driving license.</p>\n\n<p>Botswana has good tarmac roads covering most of the country but you should be careful when driving. The standard of driving is lower than in the UK and many drivers ignore road safety rules. Dangerous driving, including speeding (the maximum speed limit is 120kmh) and drink/drug driving, cause frequent serious and often fatal accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Driving, particularly outside the major urban areas, can be dangerous due to stray wildlife and livestock. This is a particular risk at night, so take extra care if you\u2019re driving after dark.</p>\n\n<p>In major towns taxis are generally safe to take. You should agree a price before setting off.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular assistance</h3>\n\n<p>If you have checked this Travel Advice and still need assistance from the British High Commission Gaborone, you can contact us via our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Botswana&amp;post=British%20High%20Commission%20Gaborone\">Online Enquiry Form</a>. If you need emergency assistance, you should call +267 395 2841.</p>\n\n<p>Botswana authorities do not always inform the British High Commission when British nationals have been arrested. If you\u2019re detained, you may insist on your right to contact a British consular officer and have access to lawyer. There is currently no comprehensive legal aid scheme and you would need to pay for any lawyer yourself.</p>\n",

For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to the UK or South Africa may be necessary. Private hospitals will not treat patients unless you can pay, and the cost of health care may be high. Outpatients must pay cash before receiving treatment. You will only be accepted as an emergency patient if you have full insurance cover. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gov.bw/en/News/rabies-outbreak-hits-ngamiland/\">rabies</a> outbreak was reported in Ngamiland, in the Delta area of north west Botswana on 8 November.

Do not touch dead animals or carcasses. If you suspect that you have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to camp or walk in the bush you should be aware of the risk of tick bites.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 997 and ask for an ambulance.
