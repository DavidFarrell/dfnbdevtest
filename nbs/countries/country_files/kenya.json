A copy of your passport is normally acceptable, but recently some police officers have been insisting on the original document.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Bag snatching is common in transport hubs like bus stations, railway stations and airports. Mugging, kidnapping, car-jacking and armed robbery occur regularly, particularly in Nairobi, Mombasa and other large cities. In Nairobi, risk of these crimes is higher in Eastleigh, Central Business District, Mathare, Kibera and slum areas. In Mombasa, crime rates are higher in the Old Town and on and around the Likoni Ferry (which links Mombasa and the southern resorts). Although uncommon, incidents of violent crime have resulted in the death of several British nationals. Gun attacks in Kwale County on the south coast resulted in fatalities in September and October 2017.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times and take into account any security advice given by your hotel, employer or your hosts. If you\u2019re attacked, don\u2019t resist. Avoid walking around after dark, especially in isolated areas like empty beaches. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don\u2019t wear expensive watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of thieves posing as police officers or private Security Guards. Always ask to see identification. Don\u2019t accept food or drink from strangers as it may be drugged.</p>\n\n<p>Only stay in tourist camps with good perimeter security. If in any doubt, seek advice from your tour operator or the Kenya Tourism Federation (telephone: + 254 20 800100).</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in any security incident, insist that the British High Commission is informed straight away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h3>\n<p>Avoid protests and political gatherings. Protests can occur in different places, be alert to media coverage and if you see a large crowd move away from the area.  Some workplaces and schools may be closed on these days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all but essential travel to within 60km of the Kenya-Somali border; to Garissa county; to Lamu county (excluding Lamu Island and Manda Island); to areas of Tana River county north of the Tana river itself and to within 15km of the coast from the Tana river down to the Galana (Athi-Galana-Sabaki) river.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island, you should do so by air to Lamu Airport (a civilian airport on Manda Island) and not by road. The only commercial option for air travel to or from Lamu Island and Manda Island is through Lamu Airport.</p>\n\n<p>For travel between Jomo Kenyatta Airport (JKIA) and Nairobi city you should use the Mombasa road or the Nairobi Expressway. There is a higher risk of car-jacking on the old airport road (Airport South Road) and Jogoo Road. The Mombasa road to JKIA can get very busy during rush hours, and check-in can take several hours; you should allow plenty of time to get to the airport. A new vehicle security check outside JKIA has also added to journey times.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to game reserves and other tourist areas are trouble-free. If you visit reserves, use reputable tour operators and arrive at your destination in daylight hours. Do not buy safari tours from touts. Always follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice.</p>\n\n<p>There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Bathing in rivers and lakes is forbidden in National Parks and is best avoided elsewhere due to the dangers from both wildlife and water-borne disease.</p>\n\n<p>Rural areas, particularly in the north and north eastern parts of Kenya, occasionally experience cattle rustling, banditry and ethnic clashes. Foreigners are not usually the target of localised violence and banditry, but you should take great care in the north and northeast.</p>\n\n<p>The Government of Kenya has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia, and Samburu counties. British nationals travelling in these areas should adhere to local security measures and exercise caution.</p>\n\n<p>Although the border with Somalia has officially been closed since 2007, crossings take place frequently. Landmines have been used in attacks around Moyale, close to the main A2 road south. Vehicles crossing the Kenya-Ethiopia border at this point should stay on the A2. Avoid staying at the rest house at Sololo - travel directly to Marsabit Town before breaking the journey.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of previous armed clashes in the area of Mount Elgon in western Kenya next to the Ugandan border, a large security presence remains and further incidents are possible. Seek local advice before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor local media and take care in all remote areas.  A Safety and Communication Centre operated by the Kenya Tourism Federation gives up to the minute tourist advice as well as providing help in an emergency. You can contact the Centre on +254 20 800100 or by e-mail to: <a href=\"mailto:operations@ktf.co.ke\">operations@ktf.co.ke</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Kenya with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months, or on a valid <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. If you\u2019re staying longer or living in Kenya, you\u2019ll need to get a Kenyan driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. Only hire vehicles from reputable companies.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions and driving standards are often poor.  Drive with windows closed and doors locked. When driving outside cities and in remote areas consider driving in convoy. Avoid driving at night wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving long-distance buses. Vehicles are often poorly maintained and driven at excessive speed. Check the bus operator\u2019s safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>Though very cheap to use, matatus (minibuses) are notorious for being poorly maintained, badly driven and uninsured. There are frequent reports of matatus being hijacked and passengers being robbed.</p>\n\n<p>On the spot fines from traffic police are common, but not legal. If stopped by a police officer you should ask for the due process to be followed. The officer should issue you with a \u2018receipt for cash bond\u2019, a piece of paper telling you when and where you need to attend court to answer the charge against you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Passenger trains run between Nairobi and Mombasa. Take care of your belongings while on the train and at railway stations. If you leave your compartment, take your valuables with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Kenya can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5Y\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are some concerns about the lack of security arrangements in place at Wilson airport in Nairobi. The airport is mainly used for domestic flights, including charters.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to charter a private aircraft, check with the company about the condition of the aircraft and runways to be used. If the company has no Safety Pilot, find another company that does.</p>\n\n<p>Local rules and regulations prohibit photography at airports. You could be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant at all times when transiting airports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>The threat of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea page</a> for more information and advice.</p>\n\n",

Attacks, including terrorist kidnappings, could target Westerners, including British nationals. Attacks could occur at any time, including around religious or other public holidays or celebrations.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate in places frequented by foreigners including hotels, bars, restaurants, sports bars and nightclubs, sporting events, supermarkets, shopping centres, commercial buildings, coastal areas including beaches, government buildings including Embassies, airports, buses, trains and other transport hubs. Places of worship including churches and mosques have also been targeted. British nationals are advised to be particularly vigilant in these areas and to consider whether there are effective local security arrangements in place (e.g bag searches, physical security, guards). You should avoid regular patterns of movement and aim to travel during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorism threat is from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia opposed to the Somali government. Al Shabaab has issued public threats against Kenya due to Kenya\u2019s military intervention in Somalia. The Kenyan authorities have increased security to counter potential reprisal attacks by Al Shabaab. There is some evidence of growing support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>On 8 January 2020 Al Shabaab released a public statement \u2018Kenya Must Take Heed\u2019; this states Al Shabaab intent to attack tourists, including those on safari trips. It also references government institutions and military installations as potential attack targets.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers to Lamu Island and Manda Island should be particularly vigilant given the close proximity of these islands to the Lamu County mainland. On 5 January 2020 Al Shabaab conducted an attack on a military airstrip in Lamu County, killing 3 US personnel. Due to the threat of terrorism, if you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island you should do so by air to Lamu Airport (a civilian airport on Manda Island), and not by road. The only commercial option for air travel to or from Lamu Island and Manda Island is through Lamu Airport.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of other terrorist attacks in Kenya in recent years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 15-16 January 2019 there was an attack at the hotel and commercial complex at 14 Riverside in Nairobi, resulting in injuries and loss of life. One British national was killed.</li>\n  <li>On 2 April 2015 there was an attack on Garissa University College in Garissa County in which at least 148 people were killed.</li>\n  <li>In June and July 2014 attacks in Lamu and Tana River Counties on the Kenyan coast are reported to have killed at least 85 people.</li>\n  <li>On 21-24 September 2013 over 60 people including six British nationals were killed in an attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In particular, there are also frequent attacks in the north-eastern border regions (Lamu, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera Counties), most of which were attributed to Al Shabaab. These have killed members of the Kenyan security forces as well as civilians. The Kenyan security forces have increased their presence in the affected areas. Armed militia groups operate within the Boni Forest and along the border with Somalia.</p>\n\n<p>Kenyan official buildings such as government offices and law enforcement personnel and facilities have been particular targets. Somali government interests in Kenya may also be targeted. Take extra security precautions if you plan on travelling to any of these places.</p>\n\n<p>Further attacks are very likely. Methods of attack have included suicide vests, grenades, knife attacks, shootings and bombings, including car bombings, and improvised explosive devices.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Kenya have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests in recent years. They have also provided extra protection including in areas near to the Somalia border and on the Kenyan coast.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping across Kenya. You should be alert to the heightened threat of terrorist kidnapping targeting Westerners, including British nationals. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps in northern counties, counties bordering Somalia and coastal counties, and further kidnaps are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. On 12 April 2019 two Cuban doctors were kidnapped in Mandera north-east Kenya. Kenyan police suspect Al-Shabaab were behind the attack. On 20 November 2018, an unknown armed gang attacked a trading centre in Chakama in Kilifi County, and abducted an Italian NGO worker. A number of kidnaps have occurred in Dadaab refugee camps in north east Kenya. British aid workers in Kenya should satisfy themselves that those arranging their stay have sufficient security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",
