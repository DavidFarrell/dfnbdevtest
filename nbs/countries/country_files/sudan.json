The political situation deteriorated significantly when violent clashes broke out in April 2023. The\u202f<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fcurrently advises against all travel to Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>The current conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to heightened tensions elsewhere in the world, and could potentially increase the risk of violence and protests in Sudan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"telecommunications\">Telecommunications</h2>\n\n<p>There are intermittent communication blackouts. Mobile phone and internet services are currently only partially available and telecommunications networks could be disrupted without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Due to the current conflict and economic situation there have been increases in opportunistic crime, petty theft, muggings, demands for money at checkpoints, mobile phone and bag-snatching (including drive-by bag snatching by thieves on motorbikes), aggressive begging (including attempts to open the doors of stationary vehicles), and burglaries.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave valuable items on display in your car while travelling and keep doors and windows closed and locked at all times. If you are stopped, avoid confrontation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Road travel will involve heightened levels of risk due to the current conflict and should only be undertaken if strictly necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic accidents are common in Sudan. There is a high risk of being involved in a traffic accident when using public transport or vehicles for hire such as rickshaws and \u2018amjad minivans\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor and many roads, even major ones, are not tarred or have potholes. Many roads are unsurfaced. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaws, as well as motor vehicles. At night, there is generally no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas south of Khartoum become inaccessible by road during the rainy season from July to October. The wadis (dry riverbeds) are subject to dangerous flash floods, and many are not passable during the rains except on a major road.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Sudan using a full UK driving licence for a maximum period of 3 months. You may be able to get a local driving licence from the police traffic department. Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many do not have these. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Sudanese law prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Khartoum International Airport (KRT) remains closed following the outbreak of violence in April 2023 and there are no commercial flight services operating to Sudan. However, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> understands that some commercial flight operations leaving Sudan, from Port Sudan Airport, have started.

In practice, non-Muslims drinking alcohol may face arrest regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Non-Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads, but should dress modestly and respect local customs and sensitivities.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual practices and extra marital relations are illegal and subject to severe penalties. This includes inviting guests into hotel rooms. Sudanese society is not tolerant of homosexual relationships.

Formally, children travelling without their father will need a letter clearly providing consent for the child to enter and exit Sudan, though this is not always enforced. The letter should be stamped at the Sudanese Embassy before travel.</p>\n\n<p>Where the father is absent or deceased, mothers or guardians should get a court order which clearly shows that the mother or guardian has sole custodial rights for the children. Where the parents are divorced, this should be accompanied by divorce documents. Where the father is deceased, this should be accompanied by a death certificate.

You will need 2 passport size photos. The fee is the Sudanese Pound equivalent of around \u00a335. If you don\u2019t register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some of the larger hotels will do this for you but you should ask when you check-in.</p>\n\n<p>Formally, visitors to Sudan on a single entry visa need to get an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. Exit visas can be processed at the airport. If requested, you should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee of 50 US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Most foreign residents, including British nationals, also need an exit permit.
