Make sure you have enough cash in euros to pay for insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>The standard of roads varies from fair to poor. Roads are particularly bad in rural areas and after bad weather. There is a risk of landslides and flooding. Avoid travelling at night if possible. The quality of fuel varies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes delays at the border crossings between Kosovo and North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania, and Kosovo and Serbia.

Taxis are readily available in Pristina. Registered taxi firms are the safest option and fares are regulated \u2013 these usually need to be ordered via phone, although some are introducing apps. Operators usually speak a reasonable level of English. Taxis that approach you for a fare are often unofficial and can overcharge. International ride-hailing apps are not available. Use established taxi companies instead of a personally owned vehicle converted to a taxi.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>During especially hot and dry periods, there is a danger of forest fires.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Kosovo lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common.
