However, you should take care if you intend to travel to Jahra, where there have been incidents involving firearms, or Jleeb Al Shuyoukh, where there have been instances of robbery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>You should only use authorised land border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Border posts can be easily missed on the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian border, but you must get an exit or entry stamp before continuing your journey. Any unauthorised movement near borders is illegal and dangerous, with armed guards regularly patrolling them. If you plan to cross the border from Kuwait into Iraq, make sure you have the correct paperwork. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mofamission.gov.iq/en/Kuwait\">Iraqi Embassy to Kuwait\u2019s website</a> for more information</p>\n\n<p>Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. You should avoid off-road driving. If you do travel off-road, restrict your movements to clearly identifiable tracks, and take great care even if an area has been officially cleared. Don\u2019t pick up any metal, plastic or other objects lying around.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you have a visit visa, you can drive in Kuwait using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> or a valid UK licence. Since 28 March 2019, it has been a requirement to have the 1968 version of the IDP, with the 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK no longer accepted in Kuwait. You can only get IDPs over the counter from UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy one outside the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving you must obtain third party insurance in Kuwait. If you\u2019re hiring a car, you can usually get insurance through your car hire company. However, if you\u2019re planning to drive a car belonging to a relative or friend then you\u2019re responsible for obtaining insurance. The insurance document must be kept with you at all times while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you live, or are considering living in Kuwait, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kuwait\">Living in Kuwait guide</a> for information on driving licences.</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions are hazardous. Many drivers pay little attention to other road users; drive in excess of speed limits; switch lanes without warning; ignore traffic lights and use mobile phones while driving.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a major accident, where there are serious injuries or your car is not drivable, you must stay with your vehicle if it is safe to do so, call the police on 112, and not attempt to move the vehicle before they arrive. If you have a minor accident, where there are no serious injuries, try to take pictures of any damage to the vehicles involved in the accident if it is safe to do so. Record the licence plate numbers of any vehicles involved, and, if it is drivable, move your car from the road to avoid blocking traffic (you can be fined if you fail to do so). Call the police and follow their instructions on what to do next.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah in the northern Gulf and both Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. The area in the northern Gulf, between Iran, Iraq and Kuwait has not been demarcated and vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. There have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Following maritime restrictions issued by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior in 2011, you should take extra care when sailing in Kuwaiti waters. You should also remain alert to the effect any regional tensions may have on your planned route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be under an increased risk of attack.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Recent developments in the Middle East have led to heightened tensions in the region. There have been a number of planned, peaceful protests in Kuwait City\u2019s Irada Square and smaller gatherings across the city, including at Kuwait University. You should continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds.\u00a0\u00a0Only Kuwaiti citizens have the legal right to assembly.</p>\n\n<p>Regional events continue to have an impact on local public opinion, with minor isolated cases of vandalism targets at and calls to boycott some international companies. You should be mindful of local sensitivities on these issues, follow the advice of the local authorities, and be alert to news reports and local and regional developments which might trigger public demonstrations.</p>\n",

There are also private medical and dental facilities. Fees are controlled by the state and are expensive. Since 1 October 2017 the Kuwaiti government has increased the cost to expatriates and visitors of using state medical facilities. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. If you\u2019re working in Kuwait, check whether your employer provides private medical insurance. If not, you\u2019re strongly advised to take out personal medical insurance for yourself and any dependents.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
