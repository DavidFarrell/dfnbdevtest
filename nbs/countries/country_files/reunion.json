Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel insurance</a> for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the\u00a0<a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/reunion/coronavirus\">Coronavirus page</a> for COVID-19 health information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries\">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<p>General health care facilities in R\u00e9union, including emergency services, and the availability of doctors\u00a0are good. \u00a0Some specialist treatment is also available.</p>\n\n<p>You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/\">get a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK</a>. If you already have an EHIC it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p>\n\n<p>The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. If you don\u2019t have your EHIC with you or you\u2019ve lost it, you can call the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 191 218 1999 to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">Read more about what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to move to R\u00e9union, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to health care provision under the French national system. Please call DWP Overseas Medical Benefits help-line on 00 44 191 218 1999. More information can be obtained direct from the English language service of the Caisse Primaire d\u2019Assurance Maladie (French social security service) on 00 33 8 20 90 42 12 or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cleiss.fr/\">CLEISS</a> (the Help desk in France for international mobility and social security) on 00 33 1 45 26 33 4.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/chikungunya-fever.aspx\">Chikungunya virus</a> have been confirmed in R\u00e9union.

If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.</p>\n",
