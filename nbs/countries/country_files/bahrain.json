This may include attempts to disrupt traffic, disturbances in villages and near economic centres. These occasionally result in localised clashes between government security forces and protesters. Anniversaries of significant events in Bahrain sometimes carry an increased risk of protests, which can start with little warning. Locations where such incidents have taken place in the past include Sitra, Bani Jamra, Karbabad, Saar, Karzakan, the Budaiya Highway and surrounding villages.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant, follow the advice of the local authorities and be aware of your surroundings wherever you are on the island.</p>\n\n<p>Violent protests pose a risk to those who might inadvertently find themselves near to an active demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter a large public gathering or demonstration, leave the area immediately. If you see any suspect item, don\u2019t approach or touch it. Move away and call the police on 999 or the Police Hotline 8000 8008.</p>\n\n<p>Travel on the main routes during daylight hours is generally orderly. There are some police checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>During demonstrations, roads can become blocked, resulting in diversions. These may re-route you to areas with which you are unfamiliar. You should familiarise yourself with alternative routes.</p>\n\n<p>Developments in the wider region continue to have an impact on local public opinion. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which may trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Interior has issued a reminder that all residents and visitors must carry photographic ID. Under Bahraini law, it\u2019s an offence not to be able to present photographic ID if asked to do so by a member of the Bahraini authorities, and you may be subject to a fine of up to 300BHD.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Around 4,000 British nationals live in Bahrain, and thousands more visit each year. Most visits are trouble free. Crime is generally uncommon in most areas, but nevertheless visitors should take due care and attention, including using reputable taxi companies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Bahrain with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer, you will need to get either a local licence or an International Driving Permit (IDP). If you are using an IDP, please ensure that you visit the Traffic Authority upon arrival to have it certified.</p>\n\n<p>As of 28 March 2019, the IDP you will need in Bahrain is a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Bahrain after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Bahrain operates a zero tolerance policy to drink-driving. If you are caught you will be arrested and put in the drivers\u2019 prison. Your case will not be heard until the next working day. First time offenders will have to pay a minimum \u00a3900 fine and could be banned from driving in Bahrain. Visitors from Saudi Arabia will be subject to the same punishment but with the addition of a driving ban there also. For repeat offenders the fine and ban will be more serious.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>Bahrain International Airport is modern and efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Although alcohol is available at Bahrain airport, security officers and airline staff deal firmly with passengers believed to be drunk - even those who are in transit through the airport. In such circumstance you may be denied boarding, detained and fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There is a Government of Bahrain imposed curfew on the waterways around Bahrain between 6.30pm and 4am. You should respect the curfew.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by Dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Many sea areas of the Gulf are considered highly sensitive by local authorities. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n",

Consuming or carrying illegal drugs, even if you are transiting through the airport from one country to another, can result in imprisonment and deportation. Buying or selling illegal drugs and narcotics is considered a serious crime which can result in life imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Bahrain such as CBD oil.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using prescribed drugs, it is advisable to carry a doctor\u2019s note. If you are bringing prescription drugs into Bahrain you may need to seek prior agreement from the authorities. You should check with the nearest Bahrain Embassy or consulate before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>Alcohol is legal in Bahrain with a number of bars, licensed restaurants and off-licences; however, drunken behaviour in public or driving under the influence of alcohol is against the law, making the offender liable to a fine or imprisonment and/or deportation and withdrawal of their driving licence. Physical assault and damaging public property whilst under the influence of alcohol is an offence, which may lead to a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones-and-uavs\">Drones and UAVs</h3>\n\n<p>Flying drones or remote-controlled Unmanned Air Vehicle flying devices either without a valid licence or in restricted airspace is against the law.

You can be charged and imprisoned if you are caught with even the smallest amount of alcohol in your system. Tailgating, speeding, racing, lane jumping and using a mobile phone while driving are all against the law and can result in heavy fines. There are numerous speed cameras on the roads and motorways. Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory. Failure to do so can result in a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code-in-bahrain\">Dress code in Bahrain</h3>\n\n<p>Dress conservatively in public places, especially religious sites.</p>\n\n<p>Bahrainis often dress conservatively in traditional dress and can be offended when people dress inappropriately or not in accordance with Islamic values.</p>\n\n<p>In public places such as shopping malls, restaurants and parks, you are encouraged to dress appropriately. Clothing should not be transparent, indecently expose parts of the body or display offensive pictures or slogans. Be aware that if you enter one of these areas dressed inappropriately you may be asked to leave (most of the larger shopping malls display signs warning that respectable clothing should be worn). Any form of nudity is strictly forbidden, including topless sunbathing. These rules are even more closely observed during Ramadan when modesty is promoted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"respect-for-religion-in-bahrain\">Respect for religion in Bahrain</h3>\n\n<p>Islamic religious values are greatly respected in Bahrain. Showing any disrespect towards religious beliefs or practices is considered deeply offensive and very likely to result in a heavy fine and/or imprisonment. Other religions are respected in Bahrain and can be followed with freedom.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Muslims pray five times a day. You will notice that the mosques call people to pray through a speaker system\n*Be aware that drivers who are not close to a mosque, may stop at a convenient lay-by to pray privately</li>\n  <li>During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Throughout this month, eating, drinking, smoking, playing loud music and dancing in public places during daylight hours are strictly forbidden and punishable by law, including for non-Muslims.</li>\n</ul>\n",

You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute.</p>\n\n<p>Travel bans are legal prohibitions the Government of Bahrain imposes to prevent persons involved in disputes from departing the country. They can be the result of a civil or criminal dispute or immigration violation. They are not lifted until the matter, i.e. civil suit; criminal case or immigration violation is settled. Persons who are involved in disputes or investigations can check if travel bans apply with the Bahrain Immigration Department. Often travellers do not learn that they are subject to a travel ban until they attempt to depart the country or on entry into the country.</p>\n\n",
