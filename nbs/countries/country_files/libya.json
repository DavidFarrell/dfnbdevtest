This advice has been in place consistently since 2014. If you\u2019re in Libya against this advice, you should seek to leave immediately by any practical means.</h3>\n\n<p>All travel to, from and within Libya is at the traveller\u2019s risk. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.</p>\n\n<p>On 10 September Storm Daniel struck Eastern Libya resulting in severe flooding and causing significant damage to critical infrastructure, including hospitals and telecommunications networks. You should follow the advice of local authorities and keep up to date with media coverage.</p>\n\n<p>On 14 August, clashes between armed groups in central Tripoli broke out, resulting in temporary roadblocks and Mitiga airport closure. Tensions have calmed, with roads now open and no further disruption to air travel from Tripoli\u2019s Mitiga Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in Libya and the British Embassy in Tripoli does not provide consular services. If you are in Libya and need urgent help from the UK government (e.g. if you have been detained) you can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-tunis\">contact the British Embassy in Tunis</a> on +216 71 108 700 or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Libya&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Tripoli\">contact us online</a>.

These may change with little warning.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Localised violence between armed groups in the capital and surrounding region can break out at short notice with little to no warning. Foreign forces and mercenaries retain a presence across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Protests  and civil unrest can also occur at short notice, including demonstrations\u00a0against deteriorating living conditions, corruption, and ongoing political instability.\u00a0Local security forces\u2019 response can be unpredictable and there is a high risk of civilians being detained or wounded if caught up in local demonstrations.\u00a0\u00a0See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Fighting between armed groups poses significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to closure due to armed clashes. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security#air-travel\">Air travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n",

                    "body": "<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n<p>The political situation in Libya remains fragile and the security situation remains dangerous and unpredictable.  A UN-facilitated ceasefire in 2020 ended militarised clashes between eastern and western armed groups, which led to an estimated 1,000 civilian casualties. While the risk of renewed fighting between eastern and western forces has decreased, the risk of localised violence between competing armed groups remains high. Outbreaks of violence between armed groups can occur with little warning. In August 2022, clashes between armed groups in Tripoli killed 32 people and injured over 150. Clashes again broke out between 14 and 15 August 2023  in central Tripoli.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign forces and mercenaries continue to operate in Libya.\u00a0 The Interim Government of National Unity has limited control of security provision across the country. The lack of political stability has led to security incidents, road and airport closures, and oil blockades. There have been protests throughout Libya against the continued political deadlock, lack of basic service provision and corruption.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against\u202f<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fadvice, you should monitor the local security situation carefully, remain vigilant, and have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-infrastructure-and-services\">Public infrastructure and services</h3>\n\n<p>The provision of basic services across Libya varies. Petrol can be difficult to access and there are regularly long queues at fuel stations. There can also be power outages in Tripoli and the south and east, particularly in the summer months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Crime is widespread across Libya and violent robbery, carjacking and smuggling of fuel, drugs, weapons and people are common across the country.  Armed groups and local security services regularly carry out operations against criminal gangs.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Foreign nationals may be a target for criminals operating in Libya and should exercise caution when travelling throughout the country, particularly at night. Consider your route and vary daily routines. Conceal expensive looking items which could draw unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention\">Detention</h3>\n\n<p>Libya\u2019s intelligence services and armed groups have detained British nationals in the past 12 months. You are at an elevated risk of detention if you are working in a field likely to be of suspicion to the intelligence services and armed groups, including but not limited to, private security, journalism or for NGOs. You should be aware that if you are detained in Libya by any of these groups, your health and welfare may be put at serious risk, especially if you have an existing medical condition. The British Embassy will have extremely limited capability to assist you or intervene on your behalf. Any assistance will be even more limited for dual nationals of Libyan origin as you will be in your home country and dual nationality is not recognised by the Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals have been arrested for failing to provide the correct documentation when requested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>In the event of a further deterioration of the security situation, routes in and out of major cities and towns may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t advertise your travel or other plans through social media. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Road traffic accidents are common.\u00a0 Facilities or services available to help in the case of a road traffic accident may be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-for-mediajournalism-purposes\">Travel for media/journalism purposes</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There are often complex bureaucratic procedures in place when operating in Libya, so it is important to ensure you follow all relevant protocols and procedures and be sensitive to local customs.</p>\n\n<p>Journalists, including foreign nationals, are vulnerable to harassment, intimidation and detention by armed groups and Libya\u2019s intelligence services. There is a real risk of hostility from those who object to media reporting. Journalism and media activity are likely to attract attention from armed groups and Libya\u2019s intelligence services who may treat foreign media with suspicion. International and local journalists have previously been detained in Libya.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of localised violence between armed groups. There is also a high risk of carjacking, robbery and of striking unexploded ordnance off-road. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk.  Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Flights to and from all airports in Libya are likely to be cancelled at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Tripoli International Airport has been closed since July 2014, following clashes that broke out between armed groups in the area surrounding the airport. Other airports may change their flight schedule without notice. Mitiga airport is Tripoli\u2019s only currently functioning civilian airport.

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. British and nationals of other Western countries are considered high value targets. Government buildings and security checkpoints have also been targeted in recent years, resulting in loss of lives.</p>\n\n<p>Extremist groups including Daesh in Libya (formerly referred to as ISIL) are responsible for the majority of attacks, which have targeted foreign and diplomatic personnel and premises, international hotels, commercial and oil installations, and government and other official security institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Although government-aligned forces, supported by US airstrikes, declared the end of operations against Daesh in Sirte in January 2016, Daesh remain a serious threat to security in Libya.</p>\n\n<p>On 7 and 14 June 2021 Daesh claimed responsibility for two separate bomb attacks on Libyan security forces in Fezzan province in southern Libya. These attacks killed at least four people.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. While there is a greater concentration of terrorist groups in the Fezzan Province, it is highly likely smaller numbers of terrorists can move relatively freely to facilitate activity outside of the Fezzan Province to other towns and regions.</p>\n\n<p>Due to increased security pressure against terrorist groups it is likely both Daesh and Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), are prioritising facilitation activity (such as weapons and people smuggling), to support terrorist operations in West Africa and are focused on maintaining their operating environment in the Fezzan Province. It is likely the threat from armed group violence has also helped to mitigate the terrorist threat in the north of Libya by further reducing the freedom of movement of terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in border regions presents an elevated risk.\u00a0 Extremist groups operating in the region, including AQIM and Daesh, conduct operations in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger and Algeria. They have a proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks, including in neighbouring countries and Libya.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups including Daesh, Al Qaeda and their affiliates routinely use kidnapping as a tactic and are capable of conducting kidnapping across borders. Terrorist groups within Libya have both intent and capability to carry out further kidnappings. It\u2019s a realistic possibility that they will target foreign nationals. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings, and there is\u00a0a realistic possibility that they would sell hostages on to terrorist groups. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Libya in the past, including four foreign nationals in south-east Libya in July 2018.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that any Kidnap for Ransom (KfR) attempt by a terrorist group in Libya would occur in the south of the country, whereas a KfR by militias would occur in a northern coastal city.</p>\n\n<p>There is a realistic possibility that a terrorist group, most likely Daesh-Libya or Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, will kidnap a Western national in Libya. In recent months, the importance of oil and natural gas production in Libya has increased, and any Western nationals working for oil and natural gas companies in Libya are highly likely viewed as high value targets. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel</a> page for information on the regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",
