                    "body": "<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n<p>Liberia has become increasingly stable since the internal conflict ended in 2003. The Liberian government is working closely with the UN and the international community to provide increased stability and development.</p>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations do take place on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Liberia\u2019s general and Presidential elections take place on 10 October and the electoral process could last for several weeks. Avoid political gatherings or demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations and rallies can be unpredictable and may turn violent. You should exercise a high degree of caution and monitor local media for developments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Liberia are incident free but there is a high level of crime in Monrovia, including armed robbery. Foreigners are occasionally targeted, although Liberians are the main victims of crime. The Liberian National Police has very limited capability to prevent or detect crime, or to provide emergency response in any part of the country. Levels of crime are much higher after dark. Don\u2019t walk anywhere in the city at night.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking alone and only do so during daylight hours.  Avoid areas where there are few people, such as beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime is opportunistic theft, but there are organised criminal gangs. Thieves are often armed with knives or machetes, but occasionally also carry firearms. While Liberians are the main victims of crime, the relative wealth of international visitors makes them an attractive target for criminals. Avoid carrying valuables or large sums of money in public and be vigilant at all times, especially at night. Mobile phones and laptops are common targets of theft.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners have been mugged in the Mamba Point and Sinkor areas of Monrovia (including Sinkor beach in broad daylight), where most international visitors stay. Be wary if you are approached by strangers. Criminals also operate in nightclubs and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation occupied by international workers has occasionally been targeted by burglars. Thefts have occurred in taxis. You should avoid local public transport. There is a high incidence of rape in Liberia. There have been cases of rapes and attempted rapes involving foreign women although these are rare.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving in heavy traffic or off the main roads.</p>\n\n<p>Consider your security arrangements carefully before your arrival in Liberia. Stay only in reputable accommodation with adequate guarding and other security arrangements, and arrange for transport, including travel to and from the airport in advance. Roberts International Airport is around 30 miles from central Monrovia, much of the journey passing through rural areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local Travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are sometimes clashes between armed groups from both sides of the Liberian/Cote d\u2019Ivoire border in some of the more remote border areas of Grand Gedeh and River Gee counties. To avoid straying into these areas, use the main roads when travelling in these counties.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the national authorities to provide emergency help outside Monrovia is limited. Check the security situation before travelling to any part of the country. Violent incidents, particularly in rural areas, are possible as a result of land disputes, illegal mining and occupation of rubber plantations. Organised groups of former combatants may be present in areas of the country where there is limited government security presence, including Sinoe rubber plantation and Sapo National Park.</p>\n\n<p>The Samuel K Doe Stadium in Monrovia can become overcrowded during major football matches or events.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h3>\n\n<p>An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. A temporary local licence may be obtained on production of a UK licence, but this may be time consuming and more expensive. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Liberia after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The roads from Monrovia to  the port town of Buchanan and to the border with Sierra Leone at Bo Waterside, and to the border with Guinea at Ganta, are mainly paved and in reasonable condition. However, the road from Monrovia to Roberts International Airport is currently undergoing roadworks and can be hazardous, and most other roads outside Monrovia are unpaved. Driving and road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season (May to November), and many roads may become impassable.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport (but with care due to ongoing roadworks). Roads are treacherous and all roads are unlit. Vehicles often do not have lights. You are more vulnerable to being robbed at an illegal check point at night.</p>\n\n<p>Make precautionary arrangements for dealing with breakdowns, including considering travel with more than one vehicle. Traffic accidents can quickly draw hostile crowds, who may attempt to take justice into their own hands. Use a local driver outside Monrovia rather than driving yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is generally poor. Be particularly alert to dangers from other vehicles swerving to avoid potholes and from taxis slowing or stopping unpredictably to pick up or drop off passengers and motorcycle taxis \u2018Pein-Peins\u2019 (the main cause of road accidents).

Its purpose is to help UK travellers to make informed decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas, including on domestic flights. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of the UK Air Safety List when considering which carriers to fly with. The list is maintained by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and Sea Travel</h3>\n<p>Liberia has many attractive beaches, but the Atlantic Ocean is subject to rip tides and other dangerous currents. Swimmers should take care and seek local advice before entering the water. Avoid canoes and fishing boats offering passenger services.

Typhoid is also common. Cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have occurred in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 August 2021 the Ministry of Health in neighbouring Guinea confirmed a case of Marburg virus disease in Guek\u00e9dou, Foresti\u00e8re Region. This is close to the border with Liberia. Liberian authorities are increasing their epidemiological surveillance levels in response. Monitor the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/97/guinea#CIoutBreaks\">NaTHNaC website</a> for the latest information. You can find more information on Marburg virus disease from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">World Health Organisation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There have been previous outbreaks of Ebola in Liberia and there was recently  an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea close to the Liberian border (the end was declared on 19 June 2021 following a 42 day countdown). Further information on Ebola can be found on the WHO website and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#current-incidents-and-outbreaks\">Public Health England (PHE) website</a>.\nPublic Health England has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ebola-virus-disease-information-for-workers-in-at-risk-countries\">guidance for humanitarian or healthcare workers</a> travelling to countries at risk of Ebola.</p>\n\n<p>Cholera and malaria are present in Liberia and have similar early symptoms to Ebola. You should check this travel advice before travelling to Liberia and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ebola-virus/Pages/Ebola-virus.aspx\">follow the health advice on the NHS website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of Lassa fever in Liberia, with several confirmed cases occurring this year.  For more information on Lassa fever, you should visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/128/liberia#CIoutBreaks\">NaTHNaC</a> website.  If you\u2019re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice.</p>\n\n<p>The 2012 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 18,000 adults aged 15 or over in Liberia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 0.9% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. \u00a0You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-medical-care\">Local medical care</h3>\n\n<p>Hospitals and medical facilities throughout Liberia are poorly equipped. There are no emergency services. Blood supplies are unreliable and unsafe, and medication is scarce. There is no effective public or commercial accident and emergency or ambulance service anywhere in the country. You should carry basic medical supplies. Medication is usually sold over the counter in pharmacies, without a prescription. However, supplies can be unreliable and medications available in the UK may not be available in Liberia. Ensure you have adequate supplies of prescription medication, bearing in mind the risk of delays due to flight cancellations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation. Most health care providers only accept cash payments.</p>\n\n<p>Previous increases in serious COVID-19 cases caused Liberian healthcare facilities to experience severe capacity constraints. There was a lack of oxygen, medication, personal protective equipment and critical care beds. There were reports that accident victims with serious injuries were turned away from hospitals, and that patients experiencing respiratory distress died due to lack of oxygen. Although confirmed COVID-19 cases have now reduced, they could increase again. You should consider the significant health risks before travelling to Liberia.</p>\n\n<p>For contact details for English speaking doctors <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liberia-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners\">visit our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>\n",
