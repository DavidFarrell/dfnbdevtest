There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious events and celebrations, such as the month of Ramadan.\u00a0 The security situation in Afghanistan is volatile.

See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a significant risk of detention of British nationals. The British Government may not be notified about such detentions\u00a0 and there are considerable challenges in securing consular contact or access. You \u00a0may not be able to contact your next of kin and detention may be lengthy without clarity being given to your charge. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security#detention\">Detention</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are no British consular officials in Afghanistan and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan. If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to \u00a0your safety and security from staying there. The situation could change quickly and without warning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should keep a low profile. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national in Afghanistan and need to speak to a consular officer, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>call the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0on 020 7008 5000 (available 24 hours a day)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Afghanistan&amp;post=Afghanistan%20travel%20advice%20team\">submit an enquiry</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>contact us on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FCDOtravelGovUK\">Twitter</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/FCDOTravel\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a British national in Afghanistan, and would like information about applying for UK visas for your family then visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk\">www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like information about applying for a British passport, or would like to check on your passport application, then visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">www.gov.uk/overseas-passports</a> or call the passport advice line on +44 (0) 300 222 0000.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Because the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Afghanistan, your travel insurance may not apply there.

If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to \u00a0your safety and security from staying \u00a0there.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should not rely on previous experience of travelling in Afghanistan or previous understanding of rules, laws and society. British nationals with previous experience of operating in Afghanistan have been detained in the country since August 2021.</p>\n\n<p>If you are found in possession of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>weapons</li>\n  <li>explosives</li>\n  <li>tracking devices</li>\n  <li>items that may be considered unusual</li>\n  <li>large quantities of money</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you have worked in the military</li>\n  <li>you have connections to previously detained British nationals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Taliban are likely to suspect you of spying and may detain you. If you are found guilty of espionage or working to undermine Afghanistan\u2019s national security, the punishment may be execution. The Taliban are suspicious of foreigners working or travelling in Afghanistan, including humanitarian workers and journalists, and it\u2019s likely your work and movements will be closely monitored.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals have been detained in Afghanistan without due process. Detention can be lengthy, damaging to health and welfare, and of uncertain outcome. You should avoid any activity which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change in Afghanistan through violence, or any activity inciting violence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sensitive-sites-and-using-cameras\">Sensitive sites and using cameras</h2>\n\n<p>You may come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with people who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs, including of locations or people that may not appear sensitive. It may not be immediately clear when taking photos could cause offence or suspicion. Avoid photographing local people without their agreement and pay close attention to local information and ways of doing things. Photographing certain buildings in Afghanistan is not allowed and may lead to detention, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>government buildings</li>\n  <li>military installations</li>\n  <li>palaces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests\">Protests</h2>\n\n<p>The current conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to protests in Afghanistan that may turn violent. Be vigilant, avoid demonstrations and take appropriate security precautions. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Human trafficking is illegal. Under the UK Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence to offer, promise or give bribes anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Afghanistan is now under Taliban control.</p>\n\n<p>People have been detained for involvement in demonstrations and for activities perceived as dissent.  Foreigners\u2019 activities are viewed with suspicion. You should not do anything which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly. Keep up to date with developments about the security situation, including through monitoring local media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>The situation at Afghanistan\u2019s border crossings remains volatile.  A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. There have been clashes between Afghan and neighbouring forces at various border crossings.</p>\n\n<p>We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are no Afghan airlines that meet UK safety standards. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Afghanistan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK.

Find out how to reduce your risk from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">terrorism</a>\u00a0while abroad.</p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious events and celebrations, such as the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaida (AQ), Daesh Khorasan Province (ISKP) and other militant groups have an active presence in Afghanistan. These groups hold strong anti-western views which could make any British interest or person a target. Daesh (ISKP) continues to be a serious threat and is fiercely hostile to the UK, other western countries and some religious minority communities. Daesh (ISKP) and other groups also target NGOs and humanitarian organisations.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Afghanistan against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, you should be aware terrorists have a strong desire to target public places frequented by foreigners. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions. An attack on Kabul International Airport in August 2021 killed at least 183 people. Further attacks against aviation and/or airports are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>In trying to target foreigners, restaurants and hotels (such as the Serena in Kabul) could be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh (ISKP) have claimed attacks\u00a0in a variety of locations such as hospitals, schools, places of worship, government, military and security establishments. Historically, government ministries (official buildings and agencies such as passport offices) have been targeted. Diplomatic premises may be attacked to undermine Taliban claims of security.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that terrorists will continue with their tactic of planning attacks at busy and congested times of day, potentially coinciding with local or religious events or celebrations. In the past this has included attacks against schools, market places, religious minorities - including targeting Shia sites, communities and districts.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks in Afghanistan include roadside and suicide bombs either on foot or by vehicle, indirect rocket and mortar fire, direct fire (including shootings and rocket propelled grenades) as well as kidnappings and violent crime. Further attacks are very likely.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Afghanistan, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly. Keep others, including family and friends, informed of your travel plans. You are strongly encouraged to avoid setting regular patterns of travel and behaviour making yourself the target of an attack.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>There is a very high threat of being kidnapped in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001; a number of them have been British nationals.  Some foreign nationals remain in captivity.</p>\n\n<p>The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. If you chose to go to Afghanistan against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",
