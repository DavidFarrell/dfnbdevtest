Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as shopping areas in major cities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnap is a risk in South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. Paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can increase the risk of hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There are regular protests and demonstrations that can turn violent. Violence could affect participants and bystanders. This can happen anywhere in South Africa at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid areas where protests, demonstrations, or marches are taking place, especially in city centres and townships. Do not cross protester roadblocks. This could provoke a violent reaction. Monitor local and social media for updates, including local radio. Where possible stick to major routes and be aware that GPS services could divert you into less secure areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high crime rate, including carjacking, \u2018smash and grab\u2019 attacks on vehicles house robbery, rape, sexual assault and murder. Violent crime can take place anywhere, including in tourist destinations and transport hubs.\u00a0 Most violent crimes occur in townships on the outskirts of major cities or in isolated areas. The threat is higher in central business districts of major cities than in suburban areas, and increases after dark.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of violent crime to visitors in the main tourist cities is generally low. There is usually additional security personnel in the main tourist areas who can assist tourists. However, policing and security can be limited, so always remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>To protect your personal safety:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not have valuables on show</li>\n  <li>do not leave valuables in your car</li>\n  <li>take safe and reliable transport <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/safety-and-security#public-transport\">see public transport</a>\n</li>\n  <li>stay alert and be wary of people who approach you</li>\n  <li>do not walk around after dark</li>\n  <li>travel with friends and make sure someone knows your plans</li>\n  <li>if you visit a township, only go with a responsible and reliable tour guide.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information on crime statistics, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=737&amp;id=5=5\">Statistics South Africa website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fraud-and-scams\">Fraud and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the risk of scams, including through business or employment opportunities, visa facilitation or offers of romance and friendships.</p>\n\n<p>Card skimming and confidence scams are widespread. There has been an increase in cybercrime and internet scamming. Do not meet up with or send money to someone you do not know.</p>\n\n<p>Crime around ATMs is common. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>hide your PIN when withdrawing money or paying by card</li>\n  <li>be aware of fraudsters, such as strangers offering to \u201chelp\u201d when your card doesn\u2019t work, or who try to lure you to an ATM</li>\n  <li>change large sums of money in banks or secure shopping malls, not in busy public areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you use a visa agent, be wary of fraud. Always follow the correct visa application process through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/applying-for-sa-visa\">Department of Home Affairs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals often use the details of embassies to carry out their fraud. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals may pose as officials for financial or personal gain. If in doubt, ask to see their ID and move into a safe, public and open space. All police officers must carry their Appointment Certificate on them. If you have any concerns, call:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>police on 10111</li>\n  <li>emergency services on 112</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h3>\n\n<p>The threat of kidnap throughout South Africa is increasing. Kidnaps are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. In recent years, several foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped. There have been reports of young children being kidnapped from shops, shopping malls and beaches.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals can be seen as wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk of kidnap for financial gain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airport-safety\">Airport safety</h3>\n\n<p>Crime can happen in and around the airport, including robbery and theft of baggage and valuables. People have been followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to their destinations and then robbed, often at gunpoint. You should be careful when following GPS navigation. You should avoid taking alternative routes away from main roads as this can often take you into less secure areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be careful in and around the airport</li>\n  <li>use main roads and highways when driving to and from airports</li>\n  <li>go through public areas quickly</li>\n  <li>avoid isolated areas</li>\n  <li>consider being met on arrival by your hotel or tour operator</li>\n  <li>go to your connecting flight quickly if in transit</li>\n  <li>consider vacuum-wrapping luggage if local regulations allow</li>\n  <li>keep valuables in your carry-on luggage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specifically for travel to and from Cape Town International Airport, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stick to the M3 and N2 where possible, and avoid the R300 and the R310 (Baden Powell) between Muizenberg and the N2 intersection</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-hijacking-and-robbery\">Vehicle hijacking and robbery</h3>\n\n<p>Vehicle hijacking and robbery are common, particularly after dark and around traffic lights, junctions, petrol stations and driveways. It is common for thieves to break car windows and take valuable while cars are waiting at a junction.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals sometimes force a vehicle to stop so they can rob those inside. Common tactics include throwing spikes (sometimes hidden in plastic bags), stones or glass in front of the vehicle. If you are targeted, drive as far as possible, or to a place of safety, before you stop.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals may pose as police and use \u2018blue lights\u2019 on plain (often white) vehicles to stop motorists and steal the vehicle. If you are suspicious, do not stop and continue to a police station, petrol station or other place of safety to call the police.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t pick up strangers or stop to help apparently distressed motorists. Continue driving and report the incident to the police. If you are involved in a hijacking, stay calm and surrender your valuables and your vehicle if asked. Do not resist.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of long queues leading to armed robberies and express kidnappings close to the Lembombo border at Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. These often take place after dark. Consider whether you can use a different crossing or only approach the border during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce your risk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check your route for any hazards or disruptions before you set off</li>\n  <li>use a GPS, but take care it does not divert you into less secure areas</li>\n  <li>keep to main roads and park in well-lit areas</li>\n  <li>always take care and consider your surroundings</li>\n  <li>avoid being stationary inside your vehicle for long periods</li>\n  <li>check your car is locked when you leave it</li>\n  <li>keep your windows closed, especially when stopped at junctions</li>\n  <li>keep valuables out of sight, ideally kept in the boot of the vehicle</li>\n  <li>ask your hire car company for a vehicle with \u2018smash and grab\u2019 film installed on the windows</li>\n  <li>ensure you can see the tarmac and the tyres of the car in front of you when you stop your vehicle, giving you space to escape if you need to</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h2>\n\n<p>There are ongoing nationwide power shortages with rolling power cuts. Scheduled regular power outages (\u2018loadshedding\u2019) have become longer and can occur daily power cuts affect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>private accommodation</li>\n  <li>shops</li>\n  <li>banks and ATMs</li>\n  <li>public lighting</li>\n  <li>traffic lights</li>\n  <li>security systems</li>\n  <li>petrol stations</li>\n  <li>water and communication services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may be higher risk of crime where security systems or public lighting do not work.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"planning-for-power-cuts\">Planning for power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>To check how it might affect you, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your accommodation provider how they mitigate loadshedding</li>\n  <li>check planned power outages on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eskom.co.za/distribution/customer-service/outages/municipal-loadshedding-schedules/\">Eskom website</a> or \u2018loadshedding\u2019 apps</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities if water restrictions, including avoiding drinking tap water, are in place</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"preparing-for-power-cuts\">Preparing for power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>Prepare for long power cuts by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>writing down emergency contact numbers and carry a notepad and pen</li>\n  <li>having an emergency plan so you can let relatives and friends know where you are</li>\n  <li>carrying a power bank with extra charging cables for electronic devices you need</li>\n  <li>carrying portable lighting, for example a torch</li>\n  <li>taking enough medicine and first aid supplies</li>\n  <li>finding safe areas close by in case you need help, such as hotels, hospitals and police stations that may have power</li>\n  <li>reading our advice for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">if you are affected by a crisis</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry a copy of your passport photo page and the page with your visitors permit or residence permit for South Africa. South African officials may request identification and proof of residence at any time. Keep your passport itself in a hotel safe or another secure location and do not carry it with you, unless needed for official identification.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legal-and-illegal-drugs\">Legal and illegal drugs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy or sell cannabis or to use it in public. Using cannabis for consumption in private is legal. Public and private use of cannabidiol oils (CBD oils) is also legal. The use, sale and purchase of all other drugs is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is legal, and it is illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade any of its parts without a permit. Trading ivory or rhino horn is banned. Anyone caught buying or trafficking banned goods will be prosecuted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Do not take unnecessary risks when participating in outdoor activities and adventure tourism. Be mindful that health and safety standards vary globally and may not be the same as you can expect in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, insist on a receiving a safety briefing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kruger-national-park\">Kruger National Park</h3>\n\n<p>After a violent attack that killed a tourist, South Africa National Parks (SANParks) advise against using the Numbi gate entrance to Kruger National Park. There have been protests and violent incidents on the R538 road leading to the gate.</p>\n\n<p>Follow SANParks advice on using alternative entrances. If you stay outside the park, contact your lodge in advance to find out if any disruptions will affect your trip. Get up-to-date <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/\">SANParks news</a> on the park website.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beach-safety\">Beach safety</h3>\n\n<p>Beach conditions and local safety measures vary. Every year, many people drown due to strong sea currents. You should ask for a life-jacket if you decide to participate in water sports.</p>\n\n<p>On beaches where there is no equipment or warning signs, speak to local people who know the conditions. If in doubt, do not enter the water.</p>\n\n<p>On busier tourist beaches, only swim between the red and yellow flags, read the warning signs and follow instructions from lifeguards. Learn more about rip currents on the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nsri.org.za/water-safety/all-about-rip-currents\">National Sea Rescue Institute\u2019s (NSRI) website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In an emergency, call:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>112 - emergency services</li>\n  <li>+27 87 094 9774 - NSRI emergency line</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-and-walking\">Hiking and walking</h3>\n\n<p>To stay safe whilst hiking, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/default.php?id=57375\">South African National Parks advise</a> that you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>save <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mcsa.org.za/activities/mountain-rescue/emergency-phone-numbers/\">emergency numbers</a> before you hike</li>\n  <li>don\u2019t hike alone</li>\n  <li>hike in groups of 4 or more</li>\n  <li>stick to busy marked trails on popular days (such as weekends)</li>\n  <li>plan your route and allow enough time</li>\n  <li>carry water, food and bring a fully charged phone</li>\n  <li>dress appropriately and be prepared for changes in weather</li>\n  <li>tell someone your route and when you expect to return</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid isolated beaches and picnic spots. Do not walk alone in remote areas or on beaches when deserted, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"table-mountain-national-park\">Table Mountain National Park</h3>\n\n<p>There have been violent attacks and muggings on hikers and tourists in Table Mountain National Park, including on Lion\u2019s Head and Signal Hill Take care in quieter areas of the park, especially during early mornings and evenings.</p>\n\n<p>Some Cape Town residents use social media platforms e.g. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hikersnetwork.co.za/\">The Hikers Network</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdoor-Cape-Town/\">Meet up</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/hikecapetown/\">Facebook</a> to coordinate hikes in larger groups.

See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/default.php?id=57375\">South African Nationals Parks</a> website for more on hiking on Table Mountain.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"e-hailing-services-like-uber-and-taxis\">E-hailing services (like Uber) and taxis</h4>\n\n<p>E-hailing service scams do occur in major cities. Make sure you use a reliable service, book the service in the app and check the vehicle registration and identity before entering the vehicle. Do not wait in the street and keep your phone or valuables out of sight. When inside the vehicle, ask the driver to close rear windows and lock doors if you cannot do so yourself. At airports, be wary of unregulated drivers posing as Uber or other e-hailing service drivers. If you order an e-hailing service, go to the designated area to wait.</p>\n\n<p>Tension between e-hailing service drivers and metered taxi drivers can lead to armed violence, particularly around Gautrain stations and airports. Strikes and protests by e-hailing service drivers are also known to take place with some attacks against drivers not seen to be participating. Passengers have been harassed or caught up in violence. High-risk areas are generally flagged in the relevant app, but exercise caution when using e-hailing services. During times of strike action find alternative reliable private transportation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"driving-standards-and-road-conditions\">Driving standards and road conditions</h4>\n\n<p>Driving standards vary in South Africa. Fatal road accidents are common, particularly around weekends and major public holidays.</p>\n\n<p>On highways, overtaking or undertaking can occur in any lane including the hard shoulder. On single-lane roads, the hard shoulder is also sometimes used by trucks and slower vehicles to allow faster vehicles to overtake. At most intersections, including 4-way stops and where traffic lights are out of service due to power outages, the first vehicle to arrive generally has priority. On larger roundabouts, you should give way to the right, although this rule is often ignored. Small roundabouts (called circles) are treated the same as a 4-way stop.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are mostly very good. Some roads in remote areas are less well maintained and may have potholes. If you are travelling to a lodge in a remote area, check road conditions with the lodge management as a car with good ground clearance may be required. Drive cautiously, obey speed limits and avoid unfamiliar areas at night. To avoid running out of fuel, keep fuel levels above half a tank. Learn more about road safety awareness on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.arrivealive.co.za/\">Arrive Alive website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a car, save the emergency roadside assistance numbers. Download an offline map if you do not have access to a GPS.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling to and from Cape Town International airport, you should stick to the M3 and N2 where possible, and avoid the R300 and the R310 (Baden Powell) between Muizenberg and the N2 intersection.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"driving-licences-in-south-africa\">Driving licences in South Africa</h4>\n\n<p>You can drive in South Africa with a valid UK photocard driving licence for up to 12 months. If you have a paper licence, you should also get an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you become a permanent resident, exchange your UK licence for a local licence within 12 months of getting your residency. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-south-africa\">Living in South Africa guide</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>These transport options are generally safe and reliable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\u2018Gautrain\u2019 train between Johannesburg, Pretoria and OR Tambo International Airport. Do not walk to or from Gautrain stations after dark</li>\n  <li>MyCiTi bus in Cape Town (central business district and Atlantic Seaboard). Do not travel into townships by MyCiTi bus. There have been violent attacks reported in Khayelitsha</li>\n  <li>airport shuttle buses through internationally recognised hotels.</li>\n  <li>internationally recognised e-hailing apps where bookings are confirmed through the app</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some transport services can be unreliable and passengers have been subject to theft and violence. These include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>minibus taxis</li>\n  <li>Metrorail train services</li>\n  <li>long-distance public train and coach services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"borders\">Borders</h2>\n\n<p>South Africa shares a border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Botswana. Be careful when crossing land borders and avoid crossing at night. Border queues can be a target for crime. Protests can happen at some border crossings, particularly at the Mozambique border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Heavy rainfall often leads to widespread flooding. Flooding can take place anywhere and at any time of year. Always check local weather reports and local news for any hazards before you start your journey. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.weathersa.co.za/\">South African Weather Service</a> provides up to date information on weather alerts and conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildfires\">Wildfires</h3>\n\n<p>Wildfires can occur in both rural and urban areas during periods of hot and dry weather. If you encounter a wild fire, move to a safe location away from vegetation and smoke. If you are inside a building or a car, close all vents and windows, if it is safe to remain in place.</p>\n\n",

See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/32/cholera\">information on cholera</a> from TravelHealthPro.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medication\">Medication</h2>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>If you take regular medication, make sure you can get repeat prescriptions if needed. Most prescription medicines in the UK need a prescription (\u2018script\u2019) from a local doctor in South Africa. The doctor may ask you to get an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK. Pharmacies are readily accessible across the country. Some have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.</p>\n\n<p>TravelHealthPro explains <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The NHS has information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/\">whether you can take your medicine abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"healthcare-facilities-in-south-africa\">Healthcare facilities in South Africa</h3>\n\n<p>Public medical care varies across South Africa. Standards of treatment and hygiene may not be the same as in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>South Africa has a very high standard of private medical care. Private healthcare can be expensive, so make sure you have the right travel health insurance and funds to cover the cost of medical treatment abroad and repatriation if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Most medical practitioners speak English, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-africa-list-of-medical-facilities\">list of medical providers in South Africa</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rehabilitation-centres-for-drug-or-alcohol-addiction\">Rehabilitation centres for drug or alcohol addiction</h3>\n\n<p>Private rehabilitation centres are widely accessible to foreigners. The British High Commission does not usually contact or visit people who have travelled specifically for medical treatment.
