In Dar es Salaam, tourists have been kidnapped, assaulted, robbed and forced with the threat of violence to withdraw cash from ATMs and arrange cash transfers of up to \u00a35,000 through Western Union after being befriended by strangers or using unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Do not accept lifts from strangers or individuals offering to procure a licensed taxi on your behalf. Do not use unlicensed taxis. Where possible, you should arrange a taxi through a reputable establishment, for example a hotel, and you should always ask to see the driver\u2019s ID. App-based taxi services are not reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Walk as far away from the road as possible and avoid walking and cycling at night. If you need to walk alongside the road, walk towards the traffic. Avoid walking and exercising alone, particularly in isolated areas and on beaches.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or other valuables including expensive jewellery or watches. Leave your passport in the hotel safe and carry a photocopy for ID at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re attacked, do not resist. If you carry a bag, it is safer to hold it loosely by the handle or hanging off your shoulder rather than by securing the strap across your chest. Bag thieves have targeted both pedestrians and cyclists.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care in places frequented by tourists and expatriate residents. In Dar es Salaam, tourists and residents have been targeted in the city centre, at Ubungo bus station, the Masaki/Oysterbay peninsula area, particularly at Coco Beach and along Toure Drive. On Zanzibar incidents have taken place in Stone Town and at hotels and on popular tourist beaches throughout the island.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure residential property is secure and lock all doors and windows, especially at night. Your security guard should insist on official identification before allowing anyone to enter your property or compound. If in doubt, do not let them in and raise the alarm.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to contact the emergency services, dial 112 and ask for the emergency service you require.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road Travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road Safety</h3>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor and driving standards are extremely poor. Road accidents resulting in death and serious injury are common. Drivers and road users frequently drive dangerously and ignore the rules of the road.</p>\n\n<p>Self-driving in Tanzania can be challenging. Check the speed limits before you drive.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant of other road users at all times and drive with caution. Vehicles and motorcycles may try to undertake and overtake in any lane on the roads, including on the hard shoulder of highways. Be wary that drivers of all vehicles often make manoeuvres without signalling beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front of you and do not approach junctions or roundabouts at speed. You should give way to the right at roundabouts, but be careful as drivers often ignore the rules.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by car, always wear a seatbelt. If you have concerns about the roadworthiness or safety of any car, then you should not travel in it.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of car hire companies is variable. Consider using reputable taxis as an alternative. There are no roadside rescue or breakdown services. Road maps are hard to come by and not always up to date. Service stations are infrequent and may not have supplies of fuel.</p>\n\n<p>Road surfaces are variable and many roads are in need of repair, including in major towns and cities. During the rainy seasons, roads may become flooded and road surfaces can deteriorate. Take extra care if you\u2019re driving during the rainy season and seek local advice before making a long car journey. You can find more information on the rainy season in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tanzania/natural-disasters\">\u2018Natural disasters\u2019</a> section .</p>\n\n<p>Driving conditions in Tanzania\u2019s national parks can be unpredictable as the roads around the parks, mainly dirt tracks, are generally poor and can become hazardous or impassable after heavy rain. A 4x4 vehicle is often required. Avoid driving out of major towns and cities at night.</p>\n\n<p>Keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, as vehicles are sometimes targeted by thieves. Be particularly careful at night when there is a higher incidence of crime and drunk driving. Avoid driving out of town at night. If you become aware of an unusual incident, or if somebody in plain clothes tries to flag you down, it is often safer not to stop.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent police road blocks. If you\u2019re stopped by the police, ask to see identification before making any payments for traffic violations. If you\u2019re involved in a road accident, co-operate with the local police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-transport\">Local transport</h3>\n\n<p>When making short journeys around towns and cities, you should avoid using local public transport. If you can use an officially licensed taxi as an alternative, you should do so.</p>\n\n<p>Local buses (known as \u2018dala dalas\u2019), motorbike taxis (\u2018boda bodas\u2019), and tuk-tuks (known locally as \u2018bijajis\u2019) do not meet western safety standards. Vehicles are often in poor condition, badly driven, and rarely have proper insurance cover.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent accidents involving dala dalas, boda bodas and tuk tuks, some of which result in fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>Pick pockets may operate on overcrowded dala dala buses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-documents\">Licences and documents</h3>\n\n<p>You will need to have an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>\u00a0to drive in Tanzania. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive yourself during a visit to Tanzania, you\u2019ll need your UK licence and an International Driving Permit. To drive in Zanzibar you\u2019ll need your UK licence and a local Zanzibar driving permit (which you can get through your hire car company). Carry several copies of your driving licence, permits and insurance documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Domestic air travel and safari journeys are often undertaken in light, mostly propeller driven, aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Tanzania.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 November 2022, a Precision Air flight from Dar es Salaam to Bukoba crashed into Lake Victoria close to Bukoba airport.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Tanzania is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5H\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel to a neighbouring country or across the region, make sure you check our travel advice for each country you intend to visit.</p>\n\n<p>Information about travel in remote areas can be patchy. Invest in an up-to-date travel guide and only use reliable tour companies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"burundi-borderkigoma-region\">Burundi border/Kigoma region</h3>\n\n<p>Take particular care in the area bordering Burundi/Kigoma region. There have been armed robberies in this area, including vehicle hijackings. Drive only in hours of daylight. There are few facilities for visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"national-parks\">National Parks</h3>\n<p>Careful planning is important to get the best out of your safari. If you choose to camp, only use official sites. Make sure you are properly equipped and seek local advice when travelling to isolated areas. Some parks are extremely remote, and emergency access and evacuation can be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Always follow park regulations and wardens\u2019 advice, and make sure you have the correct documentation or permit before entering a national park.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking\">Trekking</h3>\n<p>If you are trekking or climbing, only use a reputable travel company, stick to established routes and always walk in groups. Make sure you are well prepared and equipped to cope with the terrain and low temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in Tanzania\u2019s northeast, which is home to Mounts Meru and Kilimanjaro. More information and advice about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>In the last few years there have been several ferry disasters in which hundreds of people have died. These were ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, between the islands of Zanzibar and in the Lake Zone area.</p>\n\n<p>Use a reputable ferry company and if you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unseaworthy, do not get on. Familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.</p>\n\n<p>You should also beware of aggressive ticket touts at Tanzanian ports.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://on-shore.mschoa.org/\">designated High Risk  Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"train-travel\">Train travel</h3>\n<p>There have been several accidents on Tanzanian railways. Seek local advice for any long-distance train travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>General elections took place on 28 October 2020. The elections took place largely peacefully. You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies. On occasion, demonstrations and political rallies across Tanzania have turned violent and resulted in fatalities. Police may use tear gas and/or live ammunition for crowd control. Keep up to date with local and international events and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.

Although Tanzania has not suffered a major terrorist incidence since the bombing of the US Embassy in 1998, there have been a number of smaller scale incidents. In October 2020 the village of Kitara in the Mtawa region was attacked. Close to the border with Mozambique, the attack was claimed by Islamic extremists operating in Northern Mozambique. Most attacks target the local security forces, though attacks against Western interests are also possible.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. There is a risk of kidnapping for ransom and political purposes. Places frequented by Westerners, including places of worship, transport hubs, embassies, hotels and restaurants, and major gatherings like sporting and religious events may be targets. Previous attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches are being viewed. You should exercise heightened vigilance at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places, and follow the advice of local authorities. You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.</p>\n\n<p>Extremists linked to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab based in Somalia pose a threat across the East Africa region, and are thought to be active in Tanzania.  Attacks by IS-Mozambique, who are based in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, are possible near Tanzania\u2019s border with this area of Mozambique.  There is also thought to be some support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). The Tanzanian authorities have successfully made a number of arrests in connection to terrorism. However, many incidents in Tanzania are of unclear origin and may be conducted by criminal gangs.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>You should dress modestly. In Zanzibar and Pemba, women should avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless tops away from tourist resorts, particularly in Stone Town and other places where the local population may be offended.</p>\n\n<p>Zanzibari authorities may fine tourists, guides and tour operators for inappropriate clothing worn in public.

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the FCDO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
