If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.</p>\n\n<p>You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider or the nearest Indonesian Embassy or Consulate to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Indonesian law does not allow dual nationality for those aged 18 and older. If you are a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you could have difficulties with immigration in Indonesia.

It can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application to an immigration office within Indonesia. Make sure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine of 1 million rupiah a day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kitas-extension-stay-or-work-permit\">KITAS extension (stay or work permit)</h3>\n\n<p>KITAS holders with expiring stay permit but currently outside Indonesia can apply for an extension through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of the passport and proof of leaving Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report the foreigner\u2019s arrival within 30 days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visa-scams\">Visa scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of visa scams by fake visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong visa. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of 1 million Indonesia rupiah per day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. Use the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://molina.imigrasi.go.id/\">Indonesian Immigration self-service portal.</a></p>\n\n<p>Visa scams are increasing in Indonesia. Some travellers have lost significant amounts of money. Others have been deported despite paying large fees to an agent to get the correct visa or extension.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to use to use an agent check they are reputable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"overstaying-your-visa\">Overstaying your visa</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors who overstay without the proper permissions can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of 1 million Indonesian rupiah per day is paid.</p>\n\n<p>If you have overstayed your visa for less than 60 days, you must pay your fine at the airport.

Western interests are also at risk. Small-scale attacks occur on a regular basis and further incidents are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. Potential targets include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>beach resorts</li>\n  <li>bars and restaurants</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>markets</li>\n  <li>shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets</li>\n  <li>tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>places of worship</li>\n  <li>foreign embassies</li>\n  <li>polling stations</li>\n  <li>ferry terminals and airports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk during holiday periods such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Christmas, New Year and Easter</li>\n  <li>Chinese New Year</li>\n  <li>Nyepi (Balinese New Year)</li>\n  <li>Islamic celebrations and holidays such as Ramadan</li>\n  <li>local elections</li>\n  <li>presidential inaugurations</li>\n  <li>Independence Day (17 August)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of the local authorities, remain particularly vigilant and maintain a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, a suicide bomber attacked a Police post on Jalan Astana Anyar, in Bandung, West Java, killing one and injuring 8 people</li>\n  <li>in 2021, there was a suicide attack outside the Catholic Cathedral Church at JaIan Kajaolalido, Makassar</li>\n  <li>in 2020, a police officer was killed and another injured during an attack on a police station in Kalimantan</li>\n  <li>in 2019, a suicide bomber attacked police headquarters in Medan, Sumatra, injuring 4 police officers and 2 civilians</li>\n  <li>in 2018, there was an explosion at a police headquarters, and at 3 churches, in Surabaya, East Java, causing multiple deaths and injuries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation in Indonesia is stable. However, internal developments such as elections, presidential inaugurations and external developments, including in the Middle East, can trigger protests or unrest. Nationwide student protests took place in 2019 and 2020, and could reoccur at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all protests, demonstrations and student and political rallies as they could become violent without notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Reported cases of rape and sexual assault are high in Bali and Lombok. Exercise the same caution you would in the UK when travelling at night and avoid areas that are poorly lit.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to travel by taxi, use only registered companies (such as Bluebird, Silverbird or Express) and ensure the driver\u2019s identity is shown. If you are booking with a mobile app, check the driver is the same as the person on the app and share your journey with a friend using the app. Be wary of drivers claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps trying to pick up passengers off the street.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risk of street crime and pickpocketing, particularly in busy tourist areas in Bali, where there have been reports of bag-snatching. Concealing your bag as much as possible will help avoid bag-snatching and only carry essential items. Take care of your passport and bank cards.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of thieves on public transport. If you\u2019re travelling by car keep doors locked at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Credit card fraud is common. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. Criminals sometimes place a fake telephone number on ATMs advising customers to report problems.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licensed currency exchangers. Licensed currency exchangers can be identified by the presence of a sign titled \u2018Authorized Money Changer\u2019 and the formal name of the business, accompanied by logos and certificates issued by the Bank of Indonesia. On the logos and branding, there should be a QR Code that when opened shows the information of the business and proof of licenses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands. Make sure drinks are prepared in front of you and do not accept drinks from strangers at clubs and parties or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-strength-and-drugs\">Alcohol strength and drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars can be stronger than those in the UK and the measures of spirits are larger. In some cases, over drinking and taking drugs has resulted in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents and some British nationals have suffered psychiatric problems caused by alcohol, drugs and a lack of sleep. Drink responsibly and be aware of your limits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-poisoning-methanol\">Drink poisoning (methanol)</h3>\n\n<p>People, including British nationals, have died or suffered serious illness in Indonesia after drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol.</p>\n\n<p>Drink poisoning incidents have happened in bars, shops and hotels in tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. Criminal gangs make counterfeit replicas of well-known alcohol brands containing high amounts of methanol.</p>\n\n<p>Take extreme care when buying spirit-based drinks. Bottles may appear to be genuine when they\u2019re not, and bottle labels may not be accurate. Contaminated drinks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local spirits, including arak/arrack (a local rice or palm liquor)</li>\n  <li>spirit-based drinks, such as cocktails</li>\n  <li>brand name alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Symptoms of methanol poisoning can be similar to those of alcohol poisoning. The fact sheet on TravelHealthPro has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/25/personal-safety\">list of symptoms for methanol poisoning</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from drink poisoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>buy or drink alcoholic beverages at reputable licensed premises</li>\n  <li>be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits</li>\n  <li>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks</li>\n  <li>check bottle seals are intact</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/indonesia-list-of-medical-facilities-and-funeral-directors/list-of-medical-facilities-in-indonesia\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with show signs of alcohol-induced methanol poisoning or drink-spiking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-holidays\">Religious holidays</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Indonesia will take place on 10 March to 9 April 2024. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"balinese-new-year\">Balinese New Year</h3>\n\n<p>During Balinese New Year, known as Nyepi, local custom requires that all people in Bali observe a day of silence by staying indoors, turning off lights, and making no noise. Ngurah Rai International Airport is closed for the entire day. However, emergency services and hospitals are allowed to operate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must be able to show your valid travel document (passport) or stay permit (such as KITAS or KITAP) at any time when needed to do so by an active immigration officer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh consumption, production and distribution of alcohol are all illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process is public caning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with illegal drugs. Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process. British nationals have been caught and jailed for drug offences in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Police often raid venues (particularly in Bali) known to be frequented by foreigners. You may have to take a urine or blood test if there is a reasonable suspicion that drugs have been used. Criminal gangs in the UK and elsewhere are known to coerce people into carrying drugs across borders. Do not allow yourself to be persuaded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The province of Aceh enforces Sharia law. It is the only province in Indonesia to do so and the laws apply to both Muslims and non-Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexual activity is illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process includes public caning, prison sentence or a fine which should be paid in gold.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a license. Indonesia is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes bans on trade in ivory and tiger parts. If you\u2019re caught purchasing or trafficking illegal goods you\u2019ll be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence and fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gambling\">Gambling</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh gambling is illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process includes public caning, prison sentence or a fine which should be paid in gold.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"extra-marital-sex\">Extra-marital sex</h3>\n\n<p>In the province of Aceh, extra-marital sex is illegal under Sharia law and punishable by public caning after a Sharia court process.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You cannot drive in Indonesia using a UK driving licence. You can drive using an International Driving Permit issued in Indonesia. International Driving Permits issued in the UK may need to be endorsed by the Indonesian licensing office in Jakarta.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving, riding or hiring any type of vehicle, ensure that you have the appropriate licence to do so. Check you are covered with your travel insurance company.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic discipline is very poor and there are several moped and motorbike accidents, including serious injury and fatalities in Bali. Make sure you wear a helmet if you\u2019re riding a motorbike or moped.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners involved in even minor traffic violations or accidents may be vulnerable to exploitation. Consider employing a private driver or hiring a car with a driver. Some multinational companies do not allow their expatriate staff to drive in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in an accident or breakdown, make sure someone remains with your vehicle. If you have any concerns for your security, move to another location safely. Make yourself available for questioning by the police if requested to do so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by boat or ferry can be dangerous as the sea conditions can change rapidly. Vessels can be crowded, overloaded, poorly maintained and safety standards vary between providers.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re satisfied with safety standards before travelling, including availability of safety equipment such as life-jackets. Life-jackets suitable for children aren\u2019t always available so you may need to bring your own. Avoid travelling after dark unless you\u2019re satisfied the vessel is suitably equipped.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks against ships in and around the waters of Indonesia. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>There are lots of active volcanoes in Indonesia. They can erupt without warning. Villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius will usually be evacuated. Eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>There are 4 volcano alert levels:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>normal</li>\n  <li>advisory</li>\n  <li>watch</li>\n  <li>warning</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. Take extra care and follow the advice of the local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See the Multiplatform Application for Geohazard Mitigation and Assessment (MAGMA) in Indonesia for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://magma.esdm.go.id/v1/gunung-api/laporan\">updates on volcanic activity</a> (in Bahasa language).</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes areas beyond local exclusion zones have been affected by mud and debris flows (particularly in valleys) and volcanic ash falls. While near any volcano, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>exercise caution</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ash clouds can affect flight schedules and the operation of regional airports. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A fitted face mask may provide some protection. While masks should be available in Indonesia, you may choose to buy your own before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, be aware that you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Make sure you travel with sufficient supplies of any regular medicines to cater for this.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a major eruption, they may be increased levels of particulate and gaseous pollutants in the air, even in areas outside of the exclusion zones. Face masks only offer protection against small particulate matter; they do not protect against hazardous gases emitted by a volcano. Unless you\u2019re advised to evacuate, the best way to reduce your exposure is to remain inside and close all doors and windows.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mount-agung-bali\">Mount Agung, Bali</h3>\n\n<p>In 2018, Mount Agung in East Bali erupted, emitting gas and ash which resulted in the closure of Bali\u2019s airport and a number of nearby regional airports for a period of time. Climbers are recommended to limit activity around the crater. The alert level is subject to change at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers to Bali may find <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mount-agung-eruption-information-for-british-visitors-to-bali\">information on travel during the volcanic activity</a> useful.</p>\n\n<p>Further disruption cannot be ruled out.

Indonesian authorities have set an alert status of level 4 (of 4) and are warning of the potential for pyroclastic flows and lava flows along rivers, tributaries and valleys around Mount Semeru, especially along Besuk Kobokan, Besuk Bang, Besuk Kembar and Besuk Sat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mount-sinabung-north-sumatra\">Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra</h3>\n\n<p>FCDO\u00a0advises against all travel to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 5km of the crater of Mount Sinabung in Karo Regency, North Sumatra</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is an exclusion zone put into place by the local authorities. Mount Sinabung erupted in 2021, sending a large column of smoke and ash into the sky.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>The Indonesian rainy season runs from September to January but can run into February. Monitor international and local weather reports if travelling during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Large areas of the country have been badly affected by heavy rains, landslides and flooding, including parts of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>West Sumatra</li>\n  <li>Central, East and West Java</li>\n  <li>Jakarta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flash floods and widespread flooding can occur across Indonesia. Cities, especially Jakarta, can suffer severe localised flooding which can result in major traffic congestion and power outages. The main toll road to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and other major roads in Jakarta can be affected by flooding. Slips and landslides occur in mountainous and remote areas, but also in urban areas.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when driving and walking. Keep a stock of bottled water and make sure your phone is charged.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes-and-tsunamis\">Earthquakes and tsunamis</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes happen regularly. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p>If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes.

Take particular care in Ambon, including Haruku Island (Pulau Haruku).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"papua\">Papua</h2>\n\n<p>Armed Papuan separatist groups are fighting for independence from Indonesia in the region of Papua. Violence has been steadily increasing since 2018. The Indonesian government has a heavy security presence throughout the region especially in Highland Papua, Central Papua provinces and along the border with Papua New Guinea. There are regular armed clashes between Papuan separatist groups (known as the TPNPB-OPM) and government security forces, mainly in the regions of Highland Papua and Central Papua.</p>\n\n<p>Clashes have resulted in civilian deaths, including foreign nationals. In  2020, a New Zealand national was shot dead and a number of Indonesian nationals were wounded in a mining facility in Highland Papua province.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2023:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a New Zealand national was kidnapped by a separatist group in Nduga, Highland Papua Province</li>\n  <li>the TPNPB-OPM issued a statement that foreigners in the Papua region would be targeted</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been several instances of Papuan separatists attacking commercial aircraft servicing remote communities via small local airfields, especially in Highland Papua and Central Papua provinces. This includes aircraft which are regularly used by foreign nationals and those working in the region as the only viable means of transportation.</p>\n\n<p>Political tensions have also led to violent demonstrations in cities across Papua, which have turned violent at short notice. Take local advice to help you avoid possible demonstrations and political rallies. Internet communications might be switched off in areas where demonstrations are planned. Make plans in advance in case you are affected.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to travel in the Highland Papua and Central Papua provinces be aware that the security situation is unpredictable and can change quickly, Take local advice to understand the current tensions, and how you can reduce your personal risks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the Indonesian government passed new legislation to reform the governance and administration of the Papua region. The existing provinces of Papua and West Papua have been reorganised into 6 provinces, which are now known as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Papua</li>\n  <li>West Papua</li>\n  <li>Central Papua</li>\n  <li>Highland Papua</li>\n  <li>South Papua</li>\n  <li>Southwest Papua</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have travelled to the area previously make sure you check the updated map.</p>\n\n<p>The UK Government has no permanent presence in the region. Consular services are delivered remotely from Jakarta. There are limited hospital facilities in the region.
