The Syrian regime does not exercise control of parts of the country, notably in the north west where fighting has caused significant civilian casualties and displacement. Daesh, formerly known as ISIL, continues to operate as an insurgency and conducts regular attacks, especially in north east Syria and other terrorist groups are also active. Throughout Syria, local security situations are fragile and can deteriorate into armed clashes without warning.

Continued attacks across Syria including in major cities, have left large numbers of people dead or injured. There is also a very high threat of kidnapping throughout Syria.

There are many armed groups \u2013 both internationally-backed and domestic \u2013 controlling huge swathes of the country.</p>\n\n<p>In the north-west, a ceasefire between regime and opposition forces has been in place since March 2020. However, some violence continues involving the use of small arms, artillery and sporadic airstrikes. The earlier regime offensive displaced large numbers of civilians, caused significant civilian casualties, and severely damaged civilian infrastructure including health facilities.</p>\n\n<p>In north-east Syria, a ceasefire agreed in October 2019 remains in place but the situation remains unstable with intermittent violence.</p>\n\n<p>Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) fighters continue to operate as an insurgency and conduct regular attacks, especially in north-east Syria. Civil unrest and violent clashes between armed groups remain common throughout Syria, including in areas of north-west Syria under Turkish control, and areas of south Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting has at various times caused the temporary suspension of commercial flights, closed roads, impeded access to land border crossing points and led to the closure of some border crossings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalism\">Journalism</h3>\n<p>A number of foreign journalists have been killed during the course of the Syrian conflict. All foreign journalists entering Syria require special permission from the Syrian authorities. Those journalists and other foreigners in opposition-held areas are vulnerable to mistreatment by armed groups as well as to explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices, and the bombardment of these areas. Others have been detained by regime security forces or other armed groups during the crisis. The security forces have confiscated phones, cameras and video cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-activity\">Political activity</h3>\n<p>There are severe restrictions on political activity. Thousands of people have been detained, and in many cases tortured and executed, because of actual or perceived involvement in political activity. Foreigners engaging in unlicensed political activity are at risk of detention.</p>\n\n<p>The regime authorities have detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity. Activity in opposition-held areas will also attract attention. If you are deported by local authorities, you will not be able to return to Syria.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"humanitarian-crisis\">Humanitarian crisis</h2>\n<p>Humanitarian needs in Syria have increased significantly since the beginning of the crisis with over 13million people in need of humanitarian aid. The ongoing conflict has seriously affected public infrastructure and services. This widespread destruction has led to high unemployment, scarcity/prohibitive cost of food, lack of water, sanitation, health services and fuel. Electricity, internet and cellular services are intermittent in many parts of the country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>The escalating conflict has led to a rise in crime in most areas, including extortion at checkpoints, violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Fighting near airports has sometimes caused the temporary suspension of flights. Road networks may be blocked without warning. There are security force checkpoints on major road routes.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting and road closures have affected access to some land border crossing points. Some border crossings are in the hands of non-state armed groups, vulnerable to attack, and/or closed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Road travel remains very dangerous in many parts of the country due to fighting, the fragile security situation and unexploded ordnance. Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Driving at night is particularly dangerous. When there is a car accident with a pedestrian, the car driver is usually legally responsible.</p>\n",

There are a number of terrorist groups that operate in Syria, including Daesh and Hay\u2019at Tahrir al Sham (formerly known as  Jabhat Fatah al Sham / Al Nusrah Front).</p>\n\n<p>These groups target a wide range of places, including official installations, airports, border crossings, public transport and civilian spaces like public squares, hospitals, places of worship and learning institutions.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increased threat to Westerners in Syria. Terrorist groups continue to pose a significant threat to civilians residing in Syria and have demonstrated the ability to conduct co-ordinated attacks against armed actors and civilians.</p>\n\n<p>Targets for terrorist attacks have included: residential compounds, military establishments, oil facilities, airports, public transport, commercial venues, including markets and stores, maritime facilities, land border crossings, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, large crowds, police stations, political offices/events, sports venues/stadiums and religious sites/ceremonies. There is a heightened threat of attacks against Western interests. While attacks can take place at any time, there\u2019s a heightened threat during religious or public holidays. Methods of attack have included shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals, are high value targets for terrorists, insurgents and criminals. There\u2019s a heightened threat of terrorist attacks globally against Western interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant of this and the FCDO\u2019s advice not to travel to any part of Syria at this time.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Syria to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n<p>There is a very high threat of kidnapping throughout Syria. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain, and can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other Westerners. Some hostages have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. Westerners continue to be targeted and any Western presence in Syria would be at high risk. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",
