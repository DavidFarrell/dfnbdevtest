Pick pocketing and robbery are increasingly common in the major business and shopping districts in the capital. You should avoid wearing expensive jewellery or displaying large amounts of money in public. Keep valuables such as your passport, tickets, driving licence and credit cards secure and keep photocopies of these documents in a separate place. If you have a smartphone, you may consider taking photographs of important documents and storing them remotely.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid remote and secluded areas, quiet streets and quiet parks. Avoid the Palm Garden (Palmentium) area in Paramaribo at night. Apart from the entertainment centre around the Torarica Hotels, you should avoid walking at night anywhere in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in the interior of the country is generally trouble-free, although there have been reports of tourists being robbed. Use a well-established tour company if you intend to travel to these parts of Suriname.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>Small aircraft operate to a number of interior and regional destinations.\u00a0If using these services you should be aware of the potential risks, especially from bad weather.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Although the UN\u2019s International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2007 ruled on the maritime border dispute between Suriname and Guyana, Suriname still claims an area of land (the New River Triangle) in the south-east of Guyana. Suriname also has a border dispute with French Guiana. Keep this in mind and take care in these border areas. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, all border crossing points in Suriname are closed until further notice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban_en\">EU Air Safety List</a> was updated on 9 December 2019.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PZ\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">a list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Wing Airlines have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because the airline does not meet international safety standards. A full list of airlines banned from operating within the EU is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm\">European Commission website</a>. Refusal of permission to operate is often based on inspections of aircraft at EU airports. The fact that an airline is not included in the list doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been reports of attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Suriname.\u00a0Be vigilant and take suitable precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Driving in Suriname can be dangerous because of poor road sense of road-users, frequent hazards, inadequate lighting and poor road conditions in some areas. Drive defensively and limit driving at night as much as possible.  When driving at night take extra care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals.</p>\n\n<p>Only use taxis from reputable companies or those on official hotel taxi ranks. Don\u2019t hail taxis from the roadside.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Suriname with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n",

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. There is presently only one 24/7 medical facility available in Suriname, this is the Academisch Ziekenhuis in Paramaribo.</p>\n\n<p>Not all medical facilities accept payment from insurance companies.  Payment therefore may need to be made in advance and claimed back from the insurer.</p>\n\n<p>The UNAIDS country profile for Suriname estimated that in 2016 around 4,900 people were living with HIV. One of the key populations most affected by HIV in Suriname is sex workers, with an HIV prevalence of 5.8%. Since 2010, new HIV infections have decreased by 6% and AIDS-related deaths have increased by 17%.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 115 and ask for an ambulance.
