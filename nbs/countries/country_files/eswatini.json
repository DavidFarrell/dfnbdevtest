Avoid walking in the downtown areas of Mbabane and Manzini after dark and do not travel around in remote rural areas unless in a group. There is often an increase in criminal activity during the pre-Christmas festive season.</p>\n\n<p>Keep valuables in a safe place and avoid carrying large amounts of money or wearing conspicuous jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles have been taken at gunpoint. There have been numerous incidences of car hijackings on major routes from South Africa and Mozambique and the Mbabane- Manzini corridor. Avoid travelling by car at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political Situation</h3>\n\n<p>There has been a series of security-related incidents over the last year, including arson attacks, targeted assassinations or kidnappings of security forces personnel, ATM robberies and retaliatory police raids. As a result, demonstrations may take place at short notice, sometimes resulting in violence between protestors and security forces that have resulted in injuries and loss of life. You should be vigilant, especially after dark and avoid protests or marches. Monitor local media and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers often cross the central reservation to avoid obstructions. Speeding is a problem (the maximum speed limit is 120 km on motorways and 80 km on other unrestricted roads). Minor roads are not well maintained and road markings are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Take care on rural roads; there have been a number of serious accidents and deaths as a result of animals straying onto roads. Avoid driving on rural roads at night. As well as the possibility of hitting animals, there is the additional risk of abandoned unlit trailers and poorly lit heavy vehicles.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nBe wary of anyone who offers you help if you breakdown or need to change a tyre as it presents the opportunity for theft, muggings and hijackings. You should park in well-lit areas. Do not pick up strangers. Do not stop to assist apparently distressed motorists, as this is a technique sometimes used by hijackers. Instead, report the incident to the police.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel in a vehicle other than one registered in Eswatini, you must carry with you in the vehicle at all times proof of your customs declaration and payment of the road fund levy. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/eswatini/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">Check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a></p>\n\n<p>Travel by public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions. However, the airport transfer coaches between Johannesburg and Mbabane are generally safe. Minibuses used in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded and poorly maintained.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The FCDO can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents in Eswatini can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=UN\">Aviation Safety network</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The EU operating ban on airlines from Eswatini was lifted in April 2014.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular Eswatini Air Link services between Johannesburg OR Tambo and Sikhuphe International Airport in Eswatini.
