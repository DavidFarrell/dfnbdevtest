Monitor local and international media and avoid all demonstrations. Under Malaysian law it\u2019s illegal for foreign nationals to take part in demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---sabah\">Local travel - Sabah</h2>\n\n<p>There is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping in coastal areas of eastern Sabah from terrorist and criminal groups. The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines. Foreigners have been kidnapped from the islands of Sipadan and Mataking. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/terrorism\">Kidnap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Malaysian authorities have designated the entire eastern portion of Sabah, extending from the northern town of Kudat to Tawau district near the Indonesian border, as the Eastern Sabah Security Zone. They have established the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) to co-ordinate security forces\u2019 activity in the area. The Malaysian security forces have strengthened their presence in the area and introduced measures to reduce the risk of unauthorised boat landings.</p>\n\n<p>The local authorities have imposed curfews on travel by water in coastal areas of eastern Sabah. For the most up-to-date information, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sabahtourism.com/?locale=en\">Sabah Tourism website</a>, check local media or ask local police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from petty crime. Avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport whilst walking, in aircraft, cafes, airport and railway terminals, and hotel rooms. Do not open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone. Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take great care when using your card.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of bag snatching are common, particularly in major cities and including by thieves on motorbikes. Bags with shoulder straps should either be carried with the bag towards the pavement rather than the road, or tucked under the arm. Do not wrap the strap around your arm or shoulder and do not try to hold on to your bag. People have been injured or killed by being pulled to the ground by their bag straps.</p>\n\n<p>Taxi coupon systems are in place at airports. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.</p>\n\n<p>There have been cases of assaults and robbery, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. You should remain vigilant and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful if you\u2019re offered a drink by a stranger, even in a reputable bar or restaurant. These approaches can involve spiked drinks, and have resulted in cases of robbery and assault.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You can drive in Malaysia with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> for up to one year from your date of entry into Malaysia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>After a year, you will need to get a Malaysian driving licence. Further information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jpj.gov.my/en/web/main-site/utama\">Malaysian Road Transport Department</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals already in possession of a Malaysian driving licence can continue to renew their Malaysian driving licence as before.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions in Peninsular Malaysia are generally good, but less so in East Malaysia. Vehicles (particularly motorcycles) do not always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If you are involved in a road accident you\u2019re obliged by law to stay at the scene until the police have arrived. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to leave the scene and report to the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys.  Choose a reputable operator for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a motorbike you should take the same safety precautions as in the UK. Malaysian law states that helmets must be worn.</p>\n\n<p>Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests.  Anyone over the legal limit can face a heavy fine and/or a jail sentence and deportation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n\n<p>Piracy in South East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been a number of attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines.  Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Some passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and/or poor maintenance. Take care at all times when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat and avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water-sports-and-scuba-diving\">Water sports and scuba diving</h2>\n\n<p>If you rent jet skis or any other type of water sports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use reputable licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you\u2019re insured.</p>\n\n<p>Check dive operators\u2019 credentials carefully and make sure you\u2019re insured. Check that safety equipment is available on the boat, including oxygen. Ask about contingency plans, which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>You should take great care if you\u2019re diving the sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan. They have been declared \u2018protected places\u2019 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. You should only dive there on a \u2018look not touch\u2019 basis. Do not attempt to penetrate the wrecks, which lie in deep water. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.</p>\n",

The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), based in the Philippines, has previously kidnapped foreigners from the east coast of mainland Sabah, the islands and the surrounding waters. A number of hostages have been murdered by the group. Some groups operating in the southern Philippines, including ASG, have pledged allegiance to Daesh and are likely to regard Westerners as legitimate targets. In May 2021, Malaysian authorities arrested eight suspected ASG members who they suspect may have been planning kidnappings in Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes Sea. Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Sabah (Malaysia) and Mindanao, the Sulu Islands and Palawan (Philippines). Boats travelling to and from off-shore islands and dive sites are possible targets. The Malaysian authorities have increased security in the region in response to recent incidents.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/42/dengue\">dengue fever</a> occur all year round. There has been an increase in the number of cases of dengue fever, including in Kuala Lumpur. You should take appropriate precautions to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a></p>\n\n<p>The states of Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Sarawak have been declared as rabies infected. You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/20/rabies\">take precautions to protect yourself</a> if you\u2019re travelling in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Malaysia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/137/malaysia#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>High levels of air pollution in major urban areas in Malaysia may aggravate respiratory conditions. In recent years, between June and October, there has been a greater incidence of haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia. Haze can cause disruption to local travel, regional air travel, and to government and private schools. Monitor the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://apims.doe.gov.my\">Air Pollutant Index Management System (APIMS)</a> updates and health advisories issued by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.doe.gov.my/\">Malaysian Department of Environment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Malaysia, including Mount Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n<p>Government and private hospitals charge for all services; private care is expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 or 112 from a mobile and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you are concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it is safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you have booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
