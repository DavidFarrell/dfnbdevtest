Be alert to your surroundings if you are returning to your guest house or hotel, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Keep car doors locked and windows shut, especially in heavy traffic. Keep valuables off the seats and out of sight. Gangs sometimes try to gain entry to vehicles at busy intersections in Windhoek, including during the day. Theft from vehicles, particularly at service stations, is common. If possible don\u2019t leave your vehicle unattended at fuel stops. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of thefts from mail by Post Office workers in Namibia. Any valuable parcels or documents (eg bank and credit cards) should be sent by registered mail, and preferably by a reputable commercial courier company.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t hail taxis from the street, particularly in Windhoek, as these have been involved in thefts from foreign tourists. Ask your hotel, guest house or tour operator to recommend a reputable taxi company. Don\u2019t enter townships at night unless you are accompanied by someone with local knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Safeguard your valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible. Keep large amounts of money, expensive jewellery, cameras and cell phones out of sight. Don\u2019t change large sums of money in busy public areas. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place. Beware of pickpockets in town centres.</p>\n\n<p>There have been cases of credit card skimming at some hotels and lodges around the country. When paying by credit card, keep the card in full view at all times and always check your statement carefully.</p>\n\n<p>In case of a police emergency or to report a crime in Windhoek, you can contact the Windhoek City Police Service on 061-2902911 or toll-free 302302.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ll be driving in Namibia, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> is recommended.

If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel. If you hire a car, pay particular attention to the insurance cover provided. Most policies will not cover accidents that do not involve other vehicles or animals. Given the higher than normal probability of an accident on a gravel road because of its condition, you should take out fully comprehensive insurance on any hired vehicle. You are not allowed to use a mobile phone whilst driving.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of fatal accidents on gravel/dirt roads. \u00a0Don\u2019t exceed 80kmh on gravel. Punctures are common. If possible, carry 2 spare tyres and plenty of water.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (normally January to April) many gravel roads deteriorate. Check with your destination on the local road conditions before setting off. \u00a0Avoid driving at night outside towns as wildlife and stray livestock pose a serious hazard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adventure-sports\">Adventure sports</h3>\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance covers you for any adventure activities you plan to undertake (eg quad biking, dune boarding and hot air ballooning).</p>\n",

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n\n<p>There are good medical facilities in Windhoek. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Even with fully comprehensive travel insurance, private hospitals in Namibia may insist on proof of payment (cash or credit card) before starting treatment. They may also insist you pay up front, reclaiming from your insurer at a later date. Some travel insurance policies are not recognised by some Namibian hospitals, you should check with your provider if their product is accepted in Namibia before you travel and seek alternative coverage where necessary. Medical evacuation from remote areas can take time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of malaria throughout the year in the Caprivi Strip, Kavango and Kunene regions.  For further information see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/157/namibia#Malaria\">NaTHNaC\u2019s</a> information sheet.</p>\n\n<p>Cholera is known to occur in Namibia.</p>\n\n<p>Some people suffer skin problems and/or dehydration due to Namibia\u2019s hot and dry climate. Make sure you carry a good supply of drinkable water.</p>\n\n<p>Namibia has one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV in the world. In 2021, the UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 210,000 adults aged 15 or over in Namibia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 11.8% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 211111 (in Windhoek) or 10111 (elsewhere) and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

If you are also going to travel in South Africa, you should be aware that although South African authorities state they require 1 blank passport page for entry, some officials insist on 2 blank pages. If you plan to take this route, make sure you have a total of 3 blank pages.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>Although British nationals can enter Namibia for a holiday or private visit of up to 90 days without a visa, there have been cases where visitors have only been given permission to stay for periods much shorter than 90 days, sometimes as short as only 7 or 10 days. Before leaving the immigration desk in the airport arrivals hall, check that you have been given permission to stay in Namibia for the duration of your intended visit up to the maximum allowable of 90 days and that you have been given a correctly dated entry stamp by Namibian Immigration officials, as this will be checked on departure.\nOverstaying the time granted or an incorrect or missing entry stamp could lead to detention, arrest and a fine. If you intend to work (which includes volunteering) or stay in Namibia for a period of more than 90 days, you must get a visa from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.namibiahc.org.uk/\">Namibian High Commission</a> in London before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children-under-18\">Travelling with children (under 18)</h3>\n\n<p>Namibia introduced new immigration rules in 2016 relating to travel with children. In addition to valid passports, parents travelling with children (under 18) should at all times carry the original or certified copy of the unabridged birth certificate. The full unabridged birth certificate should list the child\u2019s details and both parents\u2019 details. The abridged (short) birth certificate which only lists the child\u2019s particulars won\u2019t be accepted by the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Adults travelling with children where they are not the biological or legal guardians of those children, should be in possession of an affidavit statement from the child\u2019s parents giving consent for their travel. If a child is travelling with only one parent, the other parent should give consent for travel in the form of an affidavit.</p>\n\n<p>Unaccompanied children may be required to provide in addition to a valid passport:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>proof of consent from one or both parents/legal guardians in the form of an affidavit</li>\n  <li>a letter from the person receiving the child including their residential address where the child will be staying</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Contact your nearest Namibian High Commission if you have any specific questions about your trip.</p>\n\n<p>If your child was born in the UK, you can order a full unabridged birth certificate online via <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate\">GOV.UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-with-children-via-a-south-african-airport\">Travelling with children via a South African airport</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re transiting through a South African airport with children, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa\">South Africa travel advice page</a> for information and advice about the documents you\u2019ll need to carry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yellow-fever-certificate-requirements\">Yellow fever certificate requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/157/namibia#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n\n",
