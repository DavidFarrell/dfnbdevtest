Single parents will need additional documents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"airport-tax\">Airport tax</h2>\n\n<p>There is an airport departure tax for international flights of 48.44 US dollars (or the same amount in Honduran lempiras). This is normally included in the cost of your ticket.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a departure tax for domestic flights of 54.13 Honduran lempiras (or the same amount in US dollars).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-to-el-salvador-guatemala-and-nicaragua\">Travelling to El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Under the Central America Border Control Agreement (also known as CA-4), you can travel between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua for up to 90 days without a visa.</p>\n\n<p>The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You\u2019ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you\u2019re expelled from one of these countries, you\u2019re also excluded from the other 3.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires.

Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent with a general breakdown in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas and there have been deaths and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>Although protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), the authorities can set up roadblocks anywhere at short notice and these cause significant travel disruptions. Your travel plans may be affected at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities. If you take part in protests, you may be detained and deported. Avoid all demonstrations and protests and do not try to pass through blockades. Follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator or airline and monitor local and social media.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are high levels of crime in Honduras. Most serious crime does not affect tourists, but there have been attacks on foreigners, including armed robbery and sexual assault. Attacks can take place anywhere at any time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Petty theft is a problem in cities and tourist areas, including the Bay Islands (Roat\u00e1n, Utila and Guanaja). Avoid walking around Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and other main towns and cities in mainland Honduras. Be particularly careful at bus stations, airports, isolated beaches, tourist sites and on public transport. Keep your valuables locked away in a safe if possible. Avoid displaying valuable items like jewellery, cameras, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atm-crime\">ATM crime</h3>\n\n<p>Criminals have robbed foreigners after they\u2019ve withdrawn money at ATMs.</p>\n\n<p>ATMs are available in the major towns. Check with your hotel which ATMs to use, especially in Roat\u00e1n. It is safer to withdraw money from ATMs in shopping centres and to change money in hotels or banks. Check ATMs for evidence of tampering, although affected machines may not be easy to spot. Do not withdraw a lot of money at one time and avoid withdrawals at night.</p>\n\n<p>People have been killed and injured resisting criminals. It is useful to carry a small amount of money to hand out if you\u2019re robbed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-attacks-against-vehicles\">Violent attacks against vehicles</h3>\n\n<p>There have been violent attacks on people in cars and buses. Using a reputable tour company for longer journeys may reduce the risks. For shorter distances, use radio-dispatched taxis or hotel taxis. It is generally safer to travel on main roads between major cities and tourist destinations.</p>\n\n<p>Take precautions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>locking vehicle doors</li>\n  <li>keeping windows closed</li>\n  <li>not travelling after dark</li>\n  <li>travelling in convoy</li>\n  <li>not picking up hitchhikers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take care if you\u2019re travelling alone. In remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or join a tour. Do not accept lifts from strangers or hitchhike.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). There has been an increase in armed attacks by local gangs on bus drivers and conductors, often resulting in serious injury or death. There have been violent muggings, rape and assault against foreigners on these buses. Private intercity coach services are safer but not immune from attack.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks on roads:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>from Limones to La Union</li>\n  <li>from Olancho via Salama to Saba</li>\n  <li>from Gualaco to San Esteban</li>\n  <li>from La Esperanza to Gracias</li>\n  <li>in the Department of Santa Barbara</li>\n  <li>in and around Tela, La Ceiba, Trujillo and El Progreso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they\u2019re asked to transfer funds to you in Honduras. Tell them to contact you to check that you\u2019ve made this request.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"state-of-exception-emergency\">State of exception (emergency)\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>As part of its plan to address extortion, the Honduras government announced a state of exception (emergency) in December 2022. This measure has been repeatedly extended and remains in place, affecting over 100 municipalities across the country.</p>\n\n<p>During this time there may be restrictions on freedom of movement and other rights in the affected municipalities. Seek advice from your travel agent. You must always carry a valid ID and be prepared for checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>allow extra time to reach your destination</li>\n  <li>monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds or demonstrations</li>\n  <li>always co-operate with military and police officers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id-and-travel-documents\">Personal ID and travel documents</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry photo ID. Carry a copy of the photo page of your passport with you. Leave the original in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you always have the documents for your hotel, car rental, tour or ticket reservations. Local authorities may stop you and ask for documents confirming your travel plans.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug trafficking (15 to 20 years in prison and a very large fine) and drug use (from 3 to 9 months in a rehabilitation centre). Honduran prisons are overcrowded and violent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal. There are no laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. There is no recognition of same-sex marriage. People in the capital, Tegucigalpa, are largely tolerant of individuals\u2019 personal lifestyles and accept small signs of affection between same-sex couples. There is a more conservative attitude outside the capital and showing affection in public is not recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>US dollars are widely accepted for exchange and payment. It is difficult to exchange British pounds in Honduras.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Honduras for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in an accident, contact the police or the fire brigade (telephone: 911), stay with your vehicle and wait for the police to arrive. If you\u2019re in a serious accident, you may be taken into custody regardless of responsibility. Seek legal help and inform the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-honduras\">British Embassy in Guatemala</a>.\u00a0 Take full details of the other driver (who may not be insured), and do not rely solely on the vehicle\u2019s number plate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards in Honduras are generally poor. Avoid road travel at night. Many vehicles travel without lights, and animals often wander across roads causing accidents. You may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle if you are not travelling on main roads.</p>\n\n<p>Public buses are often poorly maintained, overcrowded and recklessly driven. Accidents are common and sometimes fatal. Luxury buses, operated by private companies, are usually better maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Some roads remain damaged by hurricanes that struck in 2020.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Airlines in Honduras can change their schedules at short notice. Before you travel, check with your airline or travel agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Drought, forest fires and flash flooding are common in Honduras.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season in Honduras normally runs from June to November. Landslides and flooding can affect roads throughout the country. You should monitor local weather reports and check the warnings from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">US National Hurricane Center</a>.

If you are visiting Roat\u00e1n, travel with a reputable guide. If you are driving a car or scooter, avoid side roads in remote areas, particularly Palm Beach Road close to Milton Bight.</p>\n\n<p>Take care on beaches in Tela and the north coast towns after dark. There have been attacks on foreigners on beaches after dark.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of criminal attacks and carjackings in and around Tela, La Ceiba, Trujillo and El Progreso.</p>\n\n",
