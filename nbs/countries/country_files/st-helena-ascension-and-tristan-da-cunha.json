Speed limits (30 <abbr title=\"Miles per hour\">MPH</abbr> max) are signed across the island but drivers are unlikely to travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles an hour or above third gear.  Vehicles travelling downhill must give way to those travelling uphill. Driving is on the left. Drink drive laws are strictly applied with a limit of 50 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. Public transport on St Helena is very limited but hire cars are available.</p>\n\n<p>UK driving licences are valid on St Helena for three months after which a local (St Helena) licence must be obtained. Licences can be purchased from the Post Office in Jamestown and are valid for one year.</p>\n\n<p>There is a public minibus service with a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bus-Timetable-2022-FINAL.pdf\">timetable</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ascension\">Ascension</h3>\n\n<p>There is a public minibus service which operates on Friday and Saturday nights only.  There is no other public transport on Ascension Island, but bus tours with a driver can be arranged. There are a small number of hire cars.</p>\n\n<p>The speed limit is 20mph in Georgetown and Two Boats Village, and when passing the US Base. It\u2019s either 30mph or 40 mph elsewhere. If you\u2019re expecting to stay for more than 3 months, you must apply for an Ascension Island Driving Licence from the Post Office.</p>\n\n<p>Feral sheep, donkeys and land crabs (protected species) can gather on the roads, especially during wet weather.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of sites which are out of bounds. On arrival to Ascension visitors are briefed where they\u2019re permitted to visit but if you\u2019re unsure it\u2019s always worth checking with either the police station, harbour authorities or Ascension Island Government personnel first.</p>\n\n<p>The waters around Ascension can be dangerous with strong undercurrents and large swells. You should exercise extreme caution if you enter the sea. You are strongly advised to seek local advice and heed warning signs displayed at the beaches before considering swimming, diving or snorkelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tristan-da-cunha\">Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors are not allowed to hike up the Base or to Marys Peak unless accompanied by a Tristan guide. Trips to areas away from the main settlement on Tristan, including to Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands, must be made with a guide for safety reasons. A fee is payable and an indemnity declaration must be signed. Let others know where you are going and when you intend to return.</p>\n\n<p>You need prior approval from the Administrator to visit Gough Island, which is 200 miles away by sea to the south. Permission to land will rarely be granted as Gough is a World Heritage Site.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-to-st-helena-ascension-and-tristan-da-cunha\">Getting to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"st-helena-1\">St Helena</h3>\n\n<p>St Helena has weekly return flights from Johannesburg provided by Airlink.

There is a monthly charter flight to Ascension from South Africa via St Helena provided by Airlink. For both flight routes, the Ascension Island Government co-ordinates bookings to preserve access for essential workers and their families. To enquire about booking a flight contact: <a href=\"mailto:flight.bookings@ascension.gov.ac\">flight.bookings@ascension.gov.ac</a></p>\n\n<p>There is limited accommodation available to visitors on Ascension Island.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tristan-da-cunha-1\">Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<p>Travel to the Island is by sea only. Fishing/supply vessels from Cape Town visit the Island eight times a year, and there is one annual visit made by a South African research vessel in September/October. Access to berths is very limited and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://tristandc.com/shipping.php\">bookings are prioritised</a>. Due to the limited harbour facilities, vessels have to anchor offshore and passengers are ferried by smaller local boats. This can be hazardous in bad weather. Approaching bad weather can mean that you have to return to your ship ahead of schedule. Fishing requirements may mean that ships need to depart Tristan ahead of or behind schedule. Connecting airline bookings in South Africa should be flexible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-assistance\">Emergency assistance</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"st-helena-2\">St Helena</h3>\n\n<p>If you need emergency assistance, contact the local police (telephone 22626 or 999).

There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"st-helena\">St Helena</h3>\n\n<p>An adequate standard of medical care is available on St Helena, but all visitors, including UK residents, are charged a fee for medical and dental treatment.\u00a0If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ascension\">Ascension</h3>\n\n<p>There is a small hospital on Ascension that is available to deal with day-to-day complaints but sophisticated treatment is not available on the island. The hospital charges visitors for both outpatient and in-patient treatment. If you need regular supplies of prescription drugs, you should make sure you bring adequate supplies with you. A UK-qualified dentist is available on the island.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to participate in diving sports, please note that there is no decompression facility on Ascension, nor are there qualified rescue divers. Visiting divers are strongly recommended to dive with an experienced diver. There is a small diving club on the island.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tristan-da-cunha\">Tristan da Cunha</h3>\n\n<p>A\u00a0good standard of general practice level medical care is available on Tristan da Cunha. Operations and more serious medical cases usually require medical evacuation to Cape Town and this depends on the availability of ships. It might be up to two months before travel to Cape Town is possible and even then, the journey itself can take up to a week, or longer in bad weather. Limited pharmaceutical supplies are available on Tristan and you should make sure you take sufficient stock of any regular prescription medication with you.</p>\n",
