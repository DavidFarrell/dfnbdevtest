These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You will need a visa to enter Madagascar. You can get a tourist visa on arrival at the airport. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most visits to Madagascar are trouble-free. If possible, you should travel with established organisations or travel companies who know the terrain and have the capacity to warn of potential hazards and local customs. If hiring a guide in country, the National Tourism Office advises visitors to use the services of members of the Professional Tour Operators Association <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.top-madagascar.com/#membres\">PTO</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Presidential elections are due in November 2023. There is currently an increased  likelihood of political demonstrations and protests, particularly in the capital Antananarivo. Due to the possibility of violence at these events, you should avoid all demonstrations and protests. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security#Political-situation\">Political situation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow alerts and instructions from the local authorities on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BNGRCMID\">BNGRC Facebook page</a> (in French/ Malagasy). See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Crime, particularly robbery and theft is widespread in Madagascar. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security#Crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Take great care and follow local advice in the south of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. There have been several attacks on vehicles. If travelling in the area you\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator and to avoid travelling at night. Avoid overnight stays in the countryside. You\u2019re advised not to travel by taxi-brousse (bush taxi). If you\u2019re planning to travel to Fort Dauphin you should travel by air instead of via the RN 13. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/safety-and-security\">Local travel - Southern Madagascar</a></p>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no recent history of terrorism in Madagascar, attacks can\u2019t be ruled out. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and has occurred more than 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coast.

The first round will be held on 16 November with a second round, if needed, on 20 December. Security forces continue to be deployed in central Antananarivo in response to planned or short notice demonstrations. Security measures include the closure of roads and the use of tear gas.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the possibility of violence, stay away from large gatherings and political demonstrations, including those taking place in the area around Independence Square (\u201cLa Place du 13 mai\u201d) and the Town Hall in Antananarivo. Monitor local news, check your routes before travelling, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Robberies, theft and street crime occur frequently in towns and cities, in nature reserves and on beaches. Carjacking and theft from cars has become more frequent. Passengers in bush taxis have been robbed.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in the capital Antananarivo, particularly in markets and busy areas and especially vigilant at night. Don\u2019t touch any suspect packages.</p>\n\n<p>Never leave your bags unattended. Keep large amounts of money and valuable items including jewellery, cameras, computers and phones out of sight when walking outside. Use a hotel safe whenever possible to safeguard these items. Avoid walking alone in city centres after dark alone and be vigilant at all times. Foreigners are preferred targets for pickpockets and muggers. You should be vigilant when travelling around the city.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas like street markets and airports. You should carry your passport with you, but keep it concealed and secure. Leave copies of your travel documents, especially passports and flight tickets, in a safe place (e.g. hotel safe) and further copies with friends or family in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possibility of acts of disorder by security personnel and avoid any actions that might antagonise them (eg taking photographs). If you\u2019re stopped by the police, show respect and stay calm. Ask for ID as there have been reports of individuals falsely claiming to be police.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re attacked, don\u2019t resist. Stay calm and consider handing over a small sum of money. Report the incident to the police and take a copy of the police report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"useful-phone-numbers\">Useful phone numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Police: 17 or 117 from a mobile phone (emergencies).</p>\n\n<p>Fire Brigade: 18 or 118 from a mobile phone.</p>\n\n<p>Gendarmerie: 19 or 119 from a mobile phone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>There have been instances of kidnapping for ransom in Madagascar. Such cases often target wealthy foreign nationals and expatriates working for large international companies.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and keep a low profile when moving around the country. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---antananarivo\">Local travel - Antananarivo</h2>\n\n<p>Since 2012 there have been occasional explosions in Antananarivo. On 7 January 2021 an explosive device detonated in the Ampasanimalo district of Antananarivo. Don\u2019t touch any suspect packages.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 July 2022, over 30 persons were killed when criminals (dahalo) set fire to buildings in a village in the district of Ankazobe, north-west of Antananarivo. Armed forces are active in the area. Tourists have not been targeted but you should seek local advice before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---northern-madagascar\">Local travel - Northern Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>A number of incidents involving violence and robberies have occurred in Nosy Be and in Ankify Port and Ambanja on the mainland. Incidents have occurred during the day on beaches and at night in crowded areas. You should be vigilant and avoid carrying large amounts of money or jewellery.</p>\n\n<p>Use an official local guide and be vigilant if you\u2019re visiting the \u2018Montagne des Fran\u00e7ais\u2019.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---southern-madagascar\">Local travel - Southern Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>On 3 July 2023, ongoing demonstrations in the Lanirano area to the east of Fort Dauphin turned violent with reports of gunfire and injury to civilians. You are advised to avoid gatherings and demonstrations, and to follow advice of the local security services.</p>\n\n<p>Violent incidents involving cattle rustlers (Dahalo) have caused fatalities to the north of Fort Dauphin, around the township of Betroka, along the west coast between Belo sur Tsiribihina and Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) and in the Commune of Ilakakabe (near Isalo National Park). On 22 May 2021 a large scale attack on 3 villages in the Midongy district resulted in the deaths of 17 civilians and 2 military officers. Armed forces are active in these areas. Tourists have not been targeted but you should seek local advice before travelling and check road travel advice below. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in the Southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) and Fort-Dauphin remains tense and the roads are in a very poor condition. You\u2019re advised to use a recognised tour operator and avoid travelling at night in this area. If travelling to Fort Dauphin, you\u2019re advised to travel by air. Do not stay overnight in the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>Seek local advice and guidance before visiting beaches. You should remain vigilant when visiting beaches to the South and North of Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) as there have been attacks and robberies. Avoid visiting isolated and remote beaches, especially alone.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs are known to have attacked vehicles travelling in convoy on the RN7 (between Antananarivo and Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar). Be vigilant when visiting night clubs in Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel--western-madagascar\">Local travel \u2013 Western Madagascar</h2>\n\n<p>Owing to reports of violent highway robberies, you should maintain a particularly high level of vigilance and use a recognised tour operator when travelling by road to or within western regions of Madagascar (the regions between Besalampy and Morombe) including the RN35 and RN1 (between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano). You should also maintain a high level of vigilance if you travel on the following roads: RN7, RN27, RN10 and RN34. You should avoid travelling at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel---national-parks\">Local travel - National Parks</h2>\n\n<p>If you intend to visit a National Park, seek advice from a tour operator or from the park administration in advance. Maintain vigilance during your visit and do not travel at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>There are frequent armed robberies on main roads, particularly at night. Lock car doors and keep windows closed at all times particularly in Antananarivo. There have been attempts by young women using traffic jams to jump into vehicles and accuse men of sexual harassment. Where possible drive in convoy and avoid driving outside major  towns after dark. You should avoid travelling in multi-passenger taxi vans (known locally as taxi-brousses).</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t stop if you\u2019ve been involved in, or see an accident. Call the police (117) or drive to the next town and report to the police directly. Road conditions vary greatly. Most main roads outside Antananarivo carry heavy freight traffic, and have steep gradients and sharp bends. Drive with extreme care, especially on bridges.</p>\n\n<p>In the rainy season (December to April), many secondary roads are impassable (except by four-wheel-drive vehicles) and bridges are often washed away. \nThere are frequent road deaths involving bush taxis. If you have concerns over the safety of a vehicle or the ability of the driver, use alternative transport.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to drive in Madagascar you will need to get\u00a0an\u00a0 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html\">International Driving Permit.</a> or apply to convert your driving licence to a Malagasy one. The import and use of right-hand drive vehicles is now banned in Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>You should be prepared to be hassled by taxi drivers. At Antananarivo airport (but not in the city), taxi fees have been officially set. Ask the taxi driver to show you the fee table. At other airports in Madagascar, haggling over the taxi fee with the driver is normal.  You should agree the fare before setting off.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Air Madagascar has been removed from the list of airlines banned from operating within the European Union. Tsaradia and Madagasikara Airways both operate internal flights within Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5R\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Madagascar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"river-and-sea-travel\">River and sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>There have been cases of armed robberies on the Tsiribihina River in western Madagascar. If you\u2019re travelling in the region you\u2019re advised to use alternative modes of transport. Operation of river ferries may be irregular. Seek local advice on ferries from Tamatave- Sonierana to Sainte Marie Island and the West Coast (Toliara/Tul\u00e9ar, Morondava, Mahajanga and Nosy Be). There have been several reported accidents with causalities due to overcrowding, poor maintenance, poor crew training and unexpected squalls. Check weather conditions locally before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stadiums-and-venues\">Stadiums and venues</h2>\n\n<p>Security and safety standards at stadiums and venues in Madagascar may be lower than in the UK. Take care if you\u2019re planning to attend events with large numbers of spectators. On 25 August 2023 there was a stadium crush at the gates of Mahamasina Stadium in the capital, Antananarivo, where at least 12 people were killed.</p>\n\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
