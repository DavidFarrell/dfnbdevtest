In this case, your passport only needs to be valid for the duration of your stay (check the \u2018expiry date\u2019). Before applying to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/germany-residency/residence-documentation-for-uk-nationals-in-germany\">extend a German residence permit</a>, you will need to renew an expired passport and present your new passport to the local Foreigners Authority (Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-stamping\">Passport stamping</h3>\n\n<p>At German border control, you may need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>\n  <li>show you have enough money for your stay</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Germany as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you\u2019re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area.

Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (for example, to work, study or for business), you must meet the German government\u2019s entry requirements.
