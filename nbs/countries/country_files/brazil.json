Do not attempt to resist attackers \u2013 this increases the risk of injury or worse.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid wearing expensive jewellery and watches</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large sums of money - consider wearing a money belt</li>\n  <li>avoid using a mobile phone in the street</li>\n  <li>keep cameras out of sight when not in use</li>\n  <li>leave your passport and other valuables in a safe place, but carry a copy and another form of photo ID, if you have one, with you at all times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thefts are particularly common on public beaches and include \u2018arrast\u00f5es\u2019 where large groups of thieves run through an area of the beach grabbing possessions. Keep your possessions close and avoid taking valuables to the beach.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in Rio de Janeiro are thefts and pick pocketing around Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach and the areas of Lapa and Santa Theresa.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists in Rio de Janeiro have reported armed robberies on the Corcovado walking trail to the Christ the Redeemer statue. You\u2019re advised not to use the trail at this time.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in Sao Paulo are thefts or pickpocketing around Avenida Paulista and the historical downtown area. The red light districts located on Rua Augusta (north of Avenida Paulista) Catedral da S\u00e9, Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica and the Estacao de Luz metro area (where Cracolandia is located), are especially dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>In Brasilia, the central bus station area has the highest incidence of robberies and robbery of pedestrians occurs in the Federal District area. Take particular care at these locations.</p>\n\n<p>The most common incidents affecting British nationals in the north-east of Brazil are theft from hotel and motel rooms and muggings. Reduce the risk of being mugged by avoiding quiet or deserted streets and / or areas and by using taxis after sunset instead of walking.</p>\n\n<p>Robberies on buses are common in many cities. According to police statistics the most stolen items are mobile phones and the period in which the greatest number of robberies occur is between 4pm and 9pm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n<p>Thefts from cars are common; keep valuables out of sight.</p>\n\n<p>Carjacking can occur, particularly on major thoroughfares and in tunnels. Approach your car with your keys in hand so you can get into your car quicker. When driving, keep doors locked and windows closed, and take particular care at traffic lights. Where possible, use the middle lane. Avoid deserted or poorly lit areas, except under reliable local advice. Be aware of people approaching to ask for information, especially at night. If driving at night outside the city, avoid stopping at the roadside \u2013 if you need to do so try to find a petrol station/other well lit area in which to stop.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-offences\">Sexual offences</h3>\n<p>Rape and other sexual offences against tourists are rare, but there have been attacks against both men and women. Some have involved \u2018date rape\u2019 drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep them within sight at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fraud\">Fraud</h3>\n<p>Bank and credit card fraud is common, including card cloning from ATMs and in shops. Keep sight of your card at all times and do not use an ATM if you notice anything suspicious. Notify your bank in advance of your trip to avoid your card being blocked.</p>\n\n<p>If you withdraw cash at an ATM and it has any sort of pink marks, speak to the bank (or police) straight away to get it changed as it may have been marked as damaged or counterfeit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"victims-of-crime\">Victims of crime</h3>\n<p>If you or another British citizen becomes the victim of crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest British embassy or consulate. You can find more information on how we can support you in our <a href=\"/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide\">Support for British Nationals Abroad</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"favelas\">Favelas</h2>\n<p>Favelas (Portuguese for \u2018slum\u2019 or \u2018shanty town\u2019) are urban neighbourhoods of high density informal or unplanned housing. They exist in all major Brazilian cities, range in size from a few blocks to large sprawling areas, and can border areas frequented by tourists and visitors.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in many favelas is unpredictable. Any visit to a favela can be dangerous. You\u2019re advised to avoid these areas in all cities, including \u2018favela tours\u2019 marketed to tourists and any accommodation, restaurants or bars advertised as being within a favela.</p>\n\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, there are favelas located around the city, including close to the tourist area of Zona Sul and Mar\u00e9, as displayed in this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://map-of-rio-de-janeiro.com/favelas-maps/favelas-southern-zone-of-rio-de-janeiro-map\">map showing approximate locations of many favelas</a>. If you\u2019re unsure about a location, seek local advice from your hotel or the local authorities.In S\u00e3o Paulo and other cites, favelas tend to be located further from the city centre.</p>\n\n<p>Armed clashes have also occurred on major thoroughfares, including the main highway to and from the international airport in Rio de Janeiro which runs alongside a large favela. There have been incidents of tourists participating in favela tours in Rio de Janeiro being accidentally shot dead during a police operations.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violence spilling over into nearby areas, including those popular with tourists. There have been injuries and deaths as a result of stray bullets in and near favelas.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care in all Brazilian towns and cities. If you\u2019re using GPS navigation, whether by car or on foot, make sure that the suggested route doesn\u2019t take you into a favela. Avoid entering unpaved, cobbled or narrow streets which may lead into a favela. Tourists have been shot after accidentally entering a favela. Check with your hotel or the local authorities if unsure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-and-civil-unrest\">Protests and civil unrest</h2>\n\n<p>Protests, demonstrations and strikes take place regularly in cities across Brazil with reports of arrests and clashes between police and protesters. More common in urban areas, they can disrupt transport. Even events intended to be peaceful can sometimes turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas extensively to disperse protesters. The effects of tear gas can be felt several hundred metres beyond the immediate site of demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>In Sao Paulo, protests take place regularly and often without warning. Roads and public transport are frequently disrupted and there can be delays along the main road to Guarulhos International Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Popular locations for demonstrations in major cities are: Avenida Paulista, and the historic downtown area in S\u00e3o Paulo, Esplanada dos Ministerios in Brasilia and Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling or live in Brazil, take common sense precautions, follow local news reports, avoid political rallies or other events where crowds have congregated to protest and comply with the instructions of local authorities. If you encounter a political protest or feel uncomfortable in a large gathering, try to leave the area straight away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"carnival-and-other-large-scale-celebrations\">Carnival and other large-scale celebrations</h3>\n\n<p>If you are attending a large scale celebration in Brazil, such as the Carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro or other major cities, you should be aware that criminals can target people who appear to be wealthy or easy targets, such as people who have drunk a lot of alcohol. Be aware of your personal security and surroundings, be cautious about proposals from strangers which might take you away from public settings. See \u2018Crime\u2019 section above.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n<p>The Brazilian authorities publish useful information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.visitbrasil.com/visitbrasil/opencms/portalembratur/en/armacao-de-buzios.html\">travel to Brazil</a> and specific advice for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rioguiaoficial.com.br/\">travel to Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.spturis.com/v7/index.php\">travel to S\u00e3o Paulo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check the integrity and safety standards of any adventure travel companies before you use them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h2>\n<p>Public transport is likely to be disrupted during demonstrations or civil unrest. Be vigilant when using public transport, especially during rush-hour as petty crime is common. Generally, the metro systems in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo are safer than buses. Criminals often work in gangs robbing large numbers of people concentrated in the same place: public transport hubs can be particular hotspots. There have been incidents of hijacking and robbery of tour buses in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Only use licenced taxis. You can pick up a licenced taxi from the many recognised taxi ranks around Brazilian cities. Always check your taxi has the company details on the outside. Taxi apps are also a useful way to call a registered taxi; request your taxi inside if possible to avoid displaying your smartphone on the street. If your app allows this, share your journey with friends or family so they can track you.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that some taxi apps are reliant on GPS and run the risk of entering a more dangerous area of the city, in particular favelas.</p>\n\n<p>Most airports have licenced taxi desks inside the baggage reclaim areas. You can pay for your taxi in advance using a credit card or cash inside the airport rather than in the street.</p>\n\n<p>Most major cities in Brazil have facilities adapted for disabled travellers, including easy-access public buses and lifts to tube stations and platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>You can use your UK driving licence to drive in Brazil for 180 days, but an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">international driving permit</a> is recommended. After 180 days you need to apply for a Brazilian driving licence.  When driving on federal motorways (BR roads) you must turn on your headlights or face a penalty. Always observe the speed limit.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil has a high road accident rate. Overall standards of driving are poor. Travellers should be vigilant on the roads and avoid riding bicycles. In many rural areas the quality of roads away from the main highways is poor. Bus and coach crashes are frequent.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil has a zero tolerance policy on drink driving and check points are often set up. If you\u2019re caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will be prosecuted. Penalties range from fines and a suspension from driving for 12 months, to imprisonment for up to 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>All accidents involving personal injury should be reported immediately to the police by calling 190 or by attending to a police station to file a police report. Medical help can be obtained with the fire and rescue brigade at 193 or with the local emergency services (SAMU) at 192.</p>\n\n<p>Call the police on 190 if the vehicles involved are obstructing traffic and you need help.</p>\n\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, go directly to the nearest police station or Tourist Police (DEAT). You can also file a police report using the online service \u201c<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://delegaciaonline.pcivil.rj.gov.br/\">Delegacia Online</a>\u201d. The Military Police has a safety app called 190RJ, which allows you to report incidents and access the latest protective security advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n<p>Always use recognised national air carriers. There have been accidents involving light aircraft, which sometimes have poor maintenance standards.\u00a0A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PP\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>Allow plenty of time to arrive at the airport for your flight. Traffic in the main cities, especially S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, can be very heavy, particularly during rush hour.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can travel on domestic flights with a valid photo ID or a police report in case of a lost or stolen passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n<p>The railway infrastructure is limited and there have been safety and security incidents on this system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n<p>Be aware of safety procedures on board vessels and check the location of life jackets, including for children if travelling with them. Boat accidents on the Amazon river are not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Southwest river routes in the Amazon &amp; Solim\u00f5es river basin are commonly used for drug trafficking and by pirates. Both drug traffickers and pirates are likely to be armed and you should avoid travelling by river in this area. If travel is necessary seek the advice of the local authorities and take an escort.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed and unarmed attacks on merchant vessels, including British flag vessels off the Brazilian coast and in some Brazilian ports.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h2>\n<p>Strong currents can be a danger off some beaches. Take local advice before swimming including paying attention to warning flags on beaches and the location of lifeguards if present on the beach. Shark attacks are a danger particularly on the beaches around the north eastern city of Recife. You should pay attention to warning signs and consult lifeguards if unsure. Do not enter the water where warning signs are present; sharks have been known to attack in waist deep water and fatalities have occurred.</p>\n",

The UK and Brazilian authorities are committed to combatting travelling child sex offenders and the Brazilian government continues to crack down on those who commit such offences. If you commit sex offences against children abroad you can be prosecuted in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There is no legislation against homosexuality in Brazil. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil since 2013, and LGBT couples have equal rights in law.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>.
