Attacks, including in Yangon and Naypyitaw,  primarily continue to target military or regime-affiliated locations such as government buildings and checkpoints, and military-owned businesses. However, attacks may impact civilian bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and serviced accommodation complexes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Before you travel, <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a> for Myanmar\u2019s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\"><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is conflict and significant violence across much of Myanmar, involving air strikes, artillery bombardments, landmines and armed clashes. While normal daily life has resumed in many urban centres, armed groups are likely to try to carry out attacks. Shootings and explosions are common, particularly around times of increased political tension. There have been attacks against military personnel, state infrastructure (e.g. police stations, traffic police huts, ward administration centres and electricity company offices), and businesses perceived as affiliated with the military. Areas frequented by foreigners (e.g. lodging/hotels, shopping areas and restaurants) could also be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>There are increasing reports of attacks on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and National Highway 1 linking Yangon to Mandalay. For more information <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/safety-and-security#yangon-mandalay-expressway\">see Yangon-Mandalay Expressway</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Yangon, Naypyitaw, Bago, Ayarwaddy or Southern Rakhine, remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice. You should ensure you are aware of local rules, norms, and restrictions, especially if travelling to townships under martial law. You should seek advice from local tour operators before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>In Yangon, the townships currently under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but these are subject to change.  See  the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/safety-and-security\">\u2018Safety and security\u2019</a> page for more details.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk to foreigners of arbitrary arrest and detention, though this is much higher for journalists and activists. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Minor infractions of the law can provide grounds for arrest. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Myanmar are particularly sensitive to all forms of independent reporting and journalistic activity.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/burma/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>The banking sector has seen widespread disruption with many banks closed and some ATMs empty. While higher-end hotels and restaurants do tend to accept card payment, foreign cards are increasingly being declined. Check with your hotel or restaurant that they accept a foreign card. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/money\">Money</a></p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.

You should contact individual airlines for details. You should comply with overnight curfews, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you attempt to travel domestically, you are likely to encounter police or military checkpoints on your journey.</p>\n\n<p>Due to extra COVID-19 checks, it is advisable that foreigners carry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passport</li>\n  <li>Form C (immigration document)</li>\n  <li>Foreigner\u2019s Registration Certificate</li>\n  <li>Myanmar Driver\u2019s Licence (if you own a car)</li>\n  <li>a copy of your passport information page</li>\n  <li>a copy of your Myanmar visa</li>\n  <li>a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar</li>\n  <li>COVID-19 documentation e.g. proof of vaccination</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"accommodation\">Accommodation</h2>\n\n<p>There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guesthouses, and not in private apartments. Due to COVID-19, this is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.</p>\n\n<p>Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. You should make sure you have you accommodation booked before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-places-and-services\">Public places and services</h2>\n\n<p>COVID-19 restrictions remain in place. You must wear a face mask in public places. Failure to wear a mask may result in a fine.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 restrictions and policies may change without notice. You are advised to follow local media for updates or check locally within the township where you are.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare\">Healthcare</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of COVID-19, you should consult your healthcare provider. There are a small number of private hospitals in Yangon that are equipped to manage patients with severe symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>If you test positive for the virus, you may be transferred to a government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. These vary in quality. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food.</p>\n\n<p>It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention if you have COVID-19. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.</p>\n\n<p>Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in Myanmar. Most hospitals, both government and private, have their own pharmacies. A government hospital will provide a prescription for collection at their pharmacy once a patient has been assessed. To attend a private hospital or clinic you must first register, following an assessment any prescription can be collected at the pharmacy on their premises. If you are on regular medication, bring sufficient supplies with you, or is able to have their medication couriered from the UK.</p>\n\n<p>For contact details for English-speaking doctors <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners\">visit our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important.

                    "body": "<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Myanmar held national elections on 8 November 2020, in which the National League of Democracy Party won a majority. The military subsequently alleged fraud in the elections and demanded a review. On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and assumed control by force. There has been widespread political violence involving the deaths of hundreds of ordinary people, as well as a major rise in active clashes between armed actors.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher likelihood of opposition attacks and an increased presence of security forces on occasions of national significance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Myanmar National Day (4 January)</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February)</li>\n  <li>Union Day (12 February)</li>\n  <li>Peasants Day (2 March)</li>\n  <li>Armed Forces Day (27 March)</li>\n  <li>Martyrs\u2019 Day (19 July)</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the execution of political prisoners (23-25 July)</li>\n  <li>the lapsing of the state of emergency (1 August)</li>\n  <li>the 8888 uprising (8 August)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, others may have curfews or \u2018stay at home\u2019 orders, for example, in Yangon, a number of townships have a curfew from 1AM-3AM. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you arrive in an area.</p>\n\n<p>Opposition activists regularly detonate small-scale improvised explosive devices across the country. Military and government buildings; police stations; and businesses, hotels and restaurants affiliated to the military (or perceived to be) are the main targets, but there have also been attacks on schools and hospitals. While small-scale, these devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the attacks more deadly.</p>\n\n<p>Following the execution of high-profile political prisoners on 25 July 2022, there has been an increase in tensions across the country and the number of explosions in public places. Visitors to Myanmar should be extra vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. You should not attempt to photograph any gatherings.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/local-laws-and-customs#photography-and-drones\">Photography and drones</a> for more information. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring military instructions or ignoring curfews could lead to detention and/or lengthy prison sentences. Curfews are in place nationwide. Local wards may unexpectedly change rules and curfew times and it is important to remain updated on local rules.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yangon-region\">Yangon region</h2>\n\n<p>Whilst we no longer advise against all but essential travel to Yangon region, there is still a heightened risk. The security situation remains volatile and can change at short notice. If you are in the Yangon region, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice, especially if travelling to townships which are under martial law. The townships currently under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but this is subject to change.</p>\n\n<p>Security incidents in Yangon, like in the rest of Myanmar, continue to primarily target military regime-affiliated locations and personnel but may impact civilians and bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals. This may include hotels, restaurants and accommodation complexes. Military installations, such as checkpoints, are also targets. If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don\u2019t try to make your way through it. Turn around and move to safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yangon-mandalay-expressway\">Yangon-Mandalay expressway</h3>\n\n<p>There are reports of an increasing number of attacks on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and National Highway 1 linking Yangon to Mandalay. These have included the use of landmines and improvised explosive devices. There is an increased risk of attacks after dark, and an unofficial curfew is in place. You should exercise vigilance and use these roads during daylight only.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are no accurate official  statistics on violent crime or robbery against foreigners. Anecdotal evidence suggests that cases are low, although the economic pressure may cause an increase. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times. You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends, employers or hosts.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar is largely a cash society. Make sure you have access to cash, but avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold or semi-precious stones. This could result in a substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scams\">Scams</h2>\n\n<p>Be aware of job offers that appear \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d in Myanmar and neighbouring countries. There is a growing number of cyber scam centres operating in eastern Myanmar \u2013 particularly the Myawaddy district in eastern Kayin and Tachileik township in eastern Shan. Victims are trafficked into undertaking online scamming, held in poor living conditions, and subjected to severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated, and been held to ransom.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of fraudulent emails being sent by individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have falsely stated they are acting on advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/stay-alert-to-fraud-and-financial-scams-abroad\">fraud and financial scams</a> for further guidance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h2>\n\n<p>The UK advises against all travel to Northern Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni and Mon States, Sagaing Region and Tanintharyi Region excluding Myeik township, the archipelago and townships south of Tanintharyi Township. The UK advises against all but essential travel to Shan State and Southern Taninthartharyi Region.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of Ethnic Armed Organisations in Myanmar\u2019s border areas.</p>\n\n<p>Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas. The Myanmar authorities restrict travel to most border areas. There are active military operations involving the use of air strikes, artillery bombardments and ground troops.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2023, Ethnic Armed Organisations launched a military offensive in Shan State North. Travellers on the Mandalay-Lashio road should remain vigilant and exercise caution due to a heightened risk of attacks \u2013 particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>As a result of decades of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high - particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is evidence of landmine use having spread to other areas since the coup. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, but this practice is not widespread.  Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a>\u00a0that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XY\">Aviation Safety Network</a>. A Myanmar National Airlines plane was shot at in Kayah in October 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren\u2019t always advised in advance where this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges can be damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Serious road accidents are common. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor condition. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h2>\n\n<p>Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards, and search and rescue facilities may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Passenger ferries in Rakhine State have been subject to attacks.</p>\n\n<p>During the monsoon season (May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/burma/health\">Health</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phones-and-internet\">Mobile phones and Internet</h2>\n\n<p>The Myanmar authorities periodically cut off access to the Internet and have blocked several websites.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s technological infrastructure has improved. International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<p>Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive.

The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re arrested and convicted of a crime in Myanmar you can expect a long prison sentence. Conditions in detention are extremely poor. Pre-trial detention can last many months.</p>\n\n<p>The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. British nationals in Myanmar should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual abuse against children is a serious crime. Those who commit sex offences against children abroad can also be prosecuted in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug trafficking range from a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar\u2019s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring potentially arbitrary charges which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs</h2>\n\n<p>Respect religious customs when visiting Buddhist religious sites. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery.</p>\n\n<p>Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term, and can include any disrespectful depiction or image (including tattoos) of Buddha or other religious representation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"photography-and-drones\">Photography and drones</h2>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs or videos of the police, any demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior government permission and flying them in sensitive areas such as government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. As it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable. If you wish to bring a drone to Myanmar, you\u2019re strongly advised to seek official permission from the Myanmar authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"endangered-species\">Endangered species</h2>\n\n<p>Myanmar is party to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cites.org/\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)</a>. Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by CITES and EU legislation. You should consider the restrictions on the export of endangered species under CITES when deciding whether to buy exotic souvenirs, including those made from turtles.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h2>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Myanmar, although in practice these laws are not consistently enforced. These laws can carry punishments of up to life imprisonment and apply equally to men and women. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes, and allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention.</p>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards LGBT+ people can be mixed. Up until recently, there have been increasingly large Pride festivals and growing visibility of the LGBT+ community, including gay bars and clubs. Public displays of affection, whether heterosexual or LGBT+, are frowned upon in Myanmar culture.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n",

Private medical facilities continue to operate. In areas where an overnight curfew is in place, such as Yangon, you may struggle to access emergency healthcare during the night.</p>\n\n<p>Many pharmaceutical products for sale in Myanmar are believed to be counterfeit.</p>\n\n<p>Competent medical advice and treatment may not be available outside Yangon and Mandalay, and any services provided will not be to the standard of those in the UK. You may need expensive medical evacuation costing up to tens of thousands of pounds. Make sure you have adequate <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel health insurance</a> and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Avoid intrusive examinations, including emergency dental work, due to irregular hygiene standards and the danger of infection, particularly by hepatitis B and C and HIV/AIDS.  Psychological and psychiatric services are also limited.</p>\n\n<p>Cash payment is often needed prior to receiving medical treatment in Myanmar. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and/or repatriation. The UK government can not pay for medical expenses overseas.</p>\n\n<p>The worldwide coronavirus outbreak is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar\u2019s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar/coronavirus\">Coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus and Chikunguya are present in Myanmar. You should take <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">appropriate precautions</a> to avoid being bitten by mosquitos.

There is no vaccine or medication to prevent schistosomiasis. You should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater. As the infection may cause no symptoms, all travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a medical assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar has faced challenges with outbreaks of Vaccine Derived Polio Viruses (VDPV), particularly in remote areas.
