                    "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Street crime like bag snatching and pick-pocketing occurs in Montevideo. Muggings and robberies (sometimes armed) also take place. Keep valuables, spare cash and spare credit cards in a safe. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and where possible use machines that are not on the street (e.g. shopping centres or banks). Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewellery. Consider carrying cash and bankcards in separate pockets and only take with you the money you need at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Cars left on the streets at night in Montevideo are regularly broken into. Try to park in a paid car park or a well-lit and busy area. Always remember to lock your car and avoid leaving valuables, luggage, personal documents and cash in the vehicle. Don\u2019t drive with bags or other valuables visible inside your vehicle, especially not on the front seat.  There have been instances of windows being smashed and valuables grabbed when waiting at traffic lights and junctions.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking downtown or in the port area alone.</p>\n\n<p>While crime rates are generally lower in other parts of Uruguay, you should remain alert and take sensible precautions.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to report a crime, you must go to the nearest police station. You can also start to file a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://denuncia.minterior.gub.uy/en\">police report online</a> in English or Spanish. You must then sign it off at a police station within 48 hours of submitting it online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n<p>The main bus terminal for long distance journeys is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.trescruces.com.uy\">Tres Cruces</a>. The bus station has visible security patrols but you should keep a close eye on your belongings and be aware of your surroundings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive, you\u2019ll need a valid UK licence or an <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> to hire a car. You should take out full insurance.</p>\n\n<p>You must wear a seatbelt by law in the front and back seats and have a first aid kit in your car. Children under the age of 12 must also wear a seatbelt and be seated in a child or booster seat.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a zero tolerance limit for driving under the influence of alcohol. Transport Police often breathalyse drivers.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and traffic is disorganised. Drivers often change lane and make unexpected turns without indicating and use hazard lights to stop in the middle of a lane to run an errand or pick/drop someone off rather than park. Motorbikes often go the wrong way down one way streets so always look both ways when crossing junctions. Stop signs, traffic lights and speed limits are sometimes ignored. You must use dipped headlights during the day. Take extra care when driving at night.</p>\n\n<p>The main toll roads from Colonia del Sacramento to Montevideo and Punta del Este are in good condition and well-marked. However, serious road traffic accidents are common. Poor road layout and excess speed are frequent causes. Uruguay is starting to introduce electronic-tag-only tolls where you will need to prepay or link your credit card to an electronic sticker fixed to the front windscreen. For more information see: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telepeaje.com.uy\">www.telepeaje.com.uy</a> (in Spanish). Rental cars will already have the electronic tags and you will be charged for any tolls via the rental company.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of roads in the rest of Uruguay varies. Some roads may suddenly deteriorate, with potholes and uneven road surfaces requiring extra care, especially in bad weather.</p>\n\n<p>More information about transport regulations (in Spanish only) can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/transito-y-transporte/transito\">Montevideo municipality website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>The main airport is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aeropuertodecarrasco.com.uy\">Carrasco International Airport</a>\u00a0on the outskirts of Montevideo.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.

Take care when swimming in the rivers and the Atlantic Ocean taking into account currents, rocks and sand banks that have sudden descents. Beaches with lifeguards display red, amber and green flags depending on the weather conditions and a red flag with green cross when they detect conditions that present potential health risks to the population. You shouldn\u2019t go into the water when either red flag is flying.</p>\n\n",

Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.
