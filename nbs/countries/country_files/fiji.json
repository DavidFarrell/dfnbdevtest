Take care when paying with credit cards or withdrawing money from ATMs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phone-coverage\">Mobile phone coverage</h2>\n\n<p>Phone coverage in rural areas and outlying islands can be limited or non-existent. Many UK mobile phones do not work, as your provider may not have an international roaming agreement in Fiji.</p>\n\n<p>You can buy a Fiji SIM card at Nadi International Airport and at convenience stores and supermarkets.

Roads can be particularly dangerous at night due to a lack of street lighting and the chance of pedestrians or stray animals on the road. Avoid road travel outside of urban areas at night. Vehicle safety regulations are rarely enforced and driving standards are poor.</p>\n\n<p>Severe weather can lead to roads becoming damaged, blocked or washed away. Seek local advice before you set out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-minibuses\">Taxis and minibuses</h3>\n\n<p>Only use licensed taxis that have a yellow registration plate.</p>\n\n<p>Not all minibuses are licensed.

Unlicensed minibuses are probably not insured.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Check the boat operator\u2019s credentials and safety equipment before boarding boats or vessels travelling between islands. Overloaded vessels are in danger of capsizing or sinking, particularly in poor weather conditions. They may not have enough life-saving equipment for everyone on board.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Fiji is in an earthquake zone.
