Demonstrations often happen around important national holidays, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful demonstrations have sometimes turned violent.

Theft of and from vehicles is common.</p>\n\n<p>Take care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on busy public transport</li>\n  <li>in train stations</li>\n  <li>at markets</li>\n  <li>in places with high numbers of tourists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams-in-restaurants-bars-and-clubs\">Scams in restaurants, bars and clubs</h3>\n\n<p>Some restaurants, bars and clubs might charge high amounts for food and drink. Tourists have been taken to cashpoints with demands for the money to pay the bill. Always ask to see the menu and price list before ordering drinks or food, and check your bill carefully before paying. Be wary of establishments where menus do not properly display prices. Report any incidents to the police.</p>\n\n<p>Some taxi drivers are part of these frauds. They may receive a commission to recommend certain bars, clubs and restaurants to passengers. If a taxi driver offers to take you to a bar or club, or you are approached on the street with an invitation, be cautious. Use taxis from a reputable local company.</p>\n\n<p>Use official <abbr title=\"Automated Teller Machines\">ATMs</abbr> or banks. Do not change money on the street.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of drinks being spiked, particularly in Budapest bars.

Budapest is generally tolerant and open.  Recent Pride events have passed without incident, but historically there have been counter-events which have led to verbal, and sometimes physical, confrontation. Outside of Budapest, public affection may receive unwanted attention.

The vignette is a form of toll.  If you use the roads without purchasing a vignette, you will be fined.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"haulage-vehicles\">Haulage vehicles</h3>\n\n<p>If you are driving a large haulage vehicle through Hungary, make sure you have full vehicle documentation.
