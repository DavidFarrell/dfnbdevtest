The situation remains fragile and further conflict is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care if you travel to remote areas of the country notably the border with Somaliland, the north-west of Somalia and on roads north of Tadjoura where there are military roadblocks.

Driving standards are generally poor and on the main Djibouti-Ethiopia road there are a very high number of large trucks.  Many drivers use the (legal) narcotic khat and this contributes to speeding and unsafe driving.  Roads are generally narrow, poorly lit and poorly maintained. Police set up wire coils as roadblocks on some of the major roads, which are not clearly visible at night. Stay on paved roads.
