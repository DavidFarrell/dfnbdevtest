You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.  Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-demonstrations\">Political demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations sometimes take place in Montenegro, often in front of government or religious buildings. They are mostly peaceful but can lead to traffic disruption, clashes with police and the potential for violent incidents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings from street crime. Do not leave valuables unattended. Use a hotel safe if possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of violent crime between organised criminal groups can happen. Be cautious, remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. In the event of any incidents, follow all advice given by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry a valid form of ID e.g. a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Drugs laws are similar to the UK. There are strict penalties and lengthy prison sentences for possession of or trafficking of drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Taking photographs of police or military installations, personnel or vehicles is illegal and could lead to arrest and prosecution by the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>While there is a general tolerance towards same-sex couples in Montenegro, LGBT+ travellers should be aware that showing affection in public, for example, could result in unwanted attention due to the conservative nature of society in Montenegro. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have the appropriate licence and insurance when renting outdoor activity vehicles, such as jet skis and quad bikes. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re hiking in the mountains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>get expert advice from local guides</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>don\u2019t underestimate the hike, factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>take a fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hikers have got lost in the mountains when they have left marked paths.

The 2-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro\u2019s coastal areas are in better condition but can be overcrowded during the summer season.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"traffic-laws\">Traffic laws</h3>\n\n<p>Exceeding the speed limit by 10kph will get you a fine, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from 20 to 6,000 euros. Prison sentences can also be imposed.</p>\n\n<p>If you are issued with a fine, you may be able to pay the police officer by credit card, if the police vehicle is equipped with a POS terminal.  If not, you should go to a bank or post office to pay the fine within 8 days and before leaving the country. Unpaid fines for foreign nationals are recorded on a database.  If you wish to appeal, you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty of causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cartraveldocs.com/european-accident-statement\">European accident report</a> and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are sailing to Montenegro, enter only at a designated port or harbour. If this is not possible, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.luckekapetanije.me/\">local harbour master</a> (in Montenegrin only) or the police before entering.</p>\n\n<p>If you have experienced an accident at sea, call 129, the emergency number of the rescue unit within the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.me/clanak/odsjek-traganja-i-spasavanja-na-moru\">Maritime Safety Department</a> (in Montenegrin).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Wildfires are common in Montenegro from April to October due to the dry/hot weather.

Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen. The last serious earthquake was in 1979. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s website tells you about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if forest fire, earthquake or flood occurs in your area.</p>\n\n",
