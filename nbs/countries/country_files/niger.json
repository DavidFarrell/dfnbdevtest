Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners, such as:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>diplomatic premises</li>\n  <li>conference centres</li>\n  <li>locations popular with tourists and foreigners</li>\n  <li>sporting and cultural events</li>\n  <li>shopping centres</li>\n  <li>transport hubs</li>\n  <li>religious sites and places of worship, particularly churches</li>\n  <li>national parks and nature reserves; including the Parc du W</li>\n  <li>foreign, national or local government buildings</li>\n  <li>large crowds</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant, monitor announcements and local media, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillab\u00e9ri regions. Notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 2 October 2023, terrorists killed around 30 soldiers in Takanamat, Tahoua</li>\n  <li>on 30 September 2023, terrorists killed 33 soldiers in Imbalagan, Tillaberi</li>\n  <li>on 16 August 2023, terrorists killed 30 civilians in the Kandadji region, Tillaberi</li>\n  <li>on 1 February 2023, terrorists killed 18 people in an attack on a refugee camp in Tillia, Tahoua</li>\n  <li>in 2022, an IED explosion took place in Bougoum (approximately 5km from Niamey city limits) killing 2 civilians</li>\n  <li>in 2022, a Gendarme Post in Bougoum was attacked by armed individuals on motorbikes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), who operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso; and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram who operate in the Lake Chad Basin. Criminal groups also carry out kidnaps.</p>\n\n<p>Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In October 2020 an American was kidnapped (and rescued shortly after) in Massalata near the border with Nigeria. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125km south-west of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillab\u00e9ri region of Niger in April 2018.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling. You should be particularly vigilant when walking (in Niamey, you should not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time), in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, night clubs, restaurants, nature reserves and national parks, and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.</p>\n\n<p>These protests may be violent and the security situation could change quickly without warning.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 July, the Conseil\u00a0National\u00a0pour la Sauvegarde de la Patrie (CNSP) launched a military coup which has led to protests and unrest.</p>\n\n<p>The President of Niger, His Excellency Mohamed Bazoum of the PNDS political party, has been detained since 26 July.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and can be violent. If you become aware of any protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the area immediately, as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe.</p>\n\n<p>The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit March\u00e9 in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings. Avoid walking alone there, and do not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time. Be vigilant when walking anywhere in the city. Walking at night is more dangerous as there\u2019s a lack of street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks on people, including westerners, as they are leaving banks and ATMs. Be careful when using ATMs on the street, never do this at night-time, and if possible use the ATMs available in most large hotels.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Car thieves often target 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas (particularly Maradi, Tillab\u00e9ri and Diffa). You should take special care and avoid crossing borders after dark.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been hold-ups and robberies on public buses between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit. In some cases people have been killed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by internet and other scams. The scams come in many forms \u2013 romance and friendship, business ventures, or work and employment opportunities. Victims are at great financial risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Niger is a Muslim country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Be aware of your actions and dress in case they offend, especially during the month of Ramadan or if you visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you commit a crime you will be subject to local law. Local prison conditions are harsh.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You should carry identification at all times. This would normally be your passport or residence permit. If you drive outside the main towns, authorities are very likely to ask you to produce identification.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024 Ramadan in Niger is expected to be from 11 March to 9 April. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not photograph military or government installations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There is no law criminalising same-sex sexual activity in Niger. However, there are laws under the Penal Code of 1993 covering \u2018public outrage against modesty\u2019 and \u2018immodest or unnatural acts\u2019. An \u2018unnatural act\u2019 with a person of the same sex who is under the age of 21 can be punishable by a fine of up to 100,000 francs and up to 3 years imprisonment. Although we are not aware of any prosecutions under this legislation, attitudes within society towards LGBT+ people can be discriminatory.</p>\n\n<p>There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and no legal recognition of same-sex couples.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> continues to advise against all travel to Niger.\u00a0Travel within or out of Niger is\u00a0at your own risk.

If you\u2019re staying longer than 3 months, you will need to get a Nigerien licence.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.

Driving standards are poor. Vehicles often drive without lights at night and there is little street lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. Avoid travelling between towns at night.</p>\n\n<p>Aim to use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and give details of your itinerary to the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone. Make sure you have a supply of drinking water and food.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of landmines being used in Burkina Faso on the road between Ouagadougou and Niamey.
