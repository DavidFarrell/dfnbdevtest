You should make sure you have <a href=\"/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">comprehensive contingency plans</a> that don\u2019t rely on support from the Embassy, including a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas. If you\u2019re concerned about your safety, you should contact the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on +44 207 008 5000.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Before you travel, <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19\">check the \u2018Entry requirements\u2019 section</a> for South Sudan\u2019s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK Government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-nairobi\">British High Commission in Nairobi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant of the local security situation, monitor the local media, and stay in a safe location. Advice to travellers remains that you should avoid all protests and large gatherings and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.</p>\n\n<p>A ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since September 2018. However, there are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some areas of the country, as well as sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups. Serious criminality in Juba, and other urban areas, particularly during the hours of darkness, is also a regular concern. A deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy and the ongoing peace process.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a serious deterioration in the security situation, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked.  Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan\u2019s airspace.</p>\n\n<p>The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan/safety-and-security\">Safety and Security</a>. The border has now reopened following the lifting of restrictions in place in the region in response to COVID-19.

Weapons are plentiful and easily obtained in South Sudan and criminals are often armed. Many armed actors who are without jobs or have not been paid are resorting to criminality. Drive-by thefts by individuals or groups on motorbikes have been reported.</p>\n\n<p>South Sudan is an extremely difficult environment for businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to operate in. Although the number of aid workers killed in targeted attacks has reduced in recent years, South Sudan remains one of the most dangerous operating environments for aid workers in the world. Incidents of violence, intimidation, arbitrary detentions and kidnappings are reported, although these have mostly affected South Sudanese or regional nationals. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel to South Sudan, however if you decide to travel, you should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (April to October/November) most roads outside of Juba become impassable, and some parts of the country can become inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some parts of the country, and there are sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups in certain areas. Criminal attacks have taken place on the main Juba-Nimule road, which is one of the main supply routes from Uganda into South Sudan. There are reports of mines and unexploded ordnance in parts of the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re currently in South Sudan you should exercise your own judgment, based on your knowledge of the local situation, media reporting, or advice from the UN. Our advice is that you should leave South Sudan immediately if it\u2019s safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our ability to provide assistance outside Juba is severely limited. If you\u2019re concerned about your safety, you should contact the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> on +44 207 008 5000 or you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=South%20Sudan&amp;post=South%20Sudan%20travel%20advice%20team\">submit an enquiry</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Driving conditions and standards in South Sudan are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Very few roads are surfaced and maintained, particularly outside Juba. Residential areas usually have dirt roads. At night, there is almost no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaw-style cabs, as well as motor vehicles. Checkpoints, manned by armed men, are common around Juba, especially after dark.  There are regular reports of money being demanded from drivers, and of people (especially women) being physically abused at these checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The use of public transport should be avoided, due to the unsafe condition of vehicles, the regular occurrence of road traffic accidents (particularly on the Juba-Nimule road), and the high risk of robbery or assault on foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many don\u2019t have these. Make sure you have adequate insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can find a list of incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=STss\">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of every individual airline, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices.</p>\n\n<p>This list isn\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Following 5 years of internal conflict a peace agreement was signed in 2018 which has led to a significant reduction in violence; but slow and uneven implementation mean that the political and security situation remains volatile. The impact of the conflict, at both a national and local level, combined with a series of natural disasters (including flooding) drives a dire humanitarian situation across the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to remain in the country, maintain a high level of vigilance, follow political developments closely, and observe any curfews in place. In the event of civil disorder, stay at home and restrict your movements as much as possible, especially after dark. You should avoid all protests, political rallies and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services.</p>\n\n<p>There are credible reports of border incursions and engagements involving armed actors along all of South Sudan\u2019s frontiers, and you should exercise extreme caution in the country\u2019s border areas. A US-UK journalist was killed in August 2017 near the town of Kaya close to the Ugandan border during a gunfight between government forces and armed rebels.</p>\n\n",
