You should take sensible precautions with your personal safety. Do not walk around late at night alone. Keep valuables, particularly cameras and passports, out of sight. Keep a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport in a safe place, or with friends or family in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>A large proportion of the population has access to arms under the government of Eritrea\u2019s civilian militia programme. We have no evidence that these weapons increase the threat of violent crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-security-measures\">Local security measures</h3>\n\n<p>On 14 September 2022, the Eritrean Government announced a national call up of militia in response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia.\u00a0 While the call up has now ended following the peace deal between the Ethiopian Government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), extra security measures may be in place around Asmara and the rest of Eritrea.\u00a0 You should remain vigilant to the local security situation during your stay. Local travel</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are extensive mine fields in Eritrea, especially in border areas. Driving on main roads away from border areas is generally safe.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Ethiopia. All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed - travellers should check local advice before proceeding to the border.  In the border area use main paved roads and avoid driving on non-metalled roads and walking or hiking in the countryside. In September 2011, a landmine exploded on the road between Senafe and Afoma, to the east of Senafe, killing 5 people.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advise against all travel within 25 km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Djibouti. All border crossings between Djibouti and Eritrea are currently closed. In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. Though relations have improved, the situation remains unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea\u2019s border with Sudan. The border with Sudan is operational in response to the Sudanese conflict. There are ongoing reports of banditry in and around the border area.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling after dark in rural areas. Road signage and barriers are scarce, road surfaces are uneven \u2013 causing erratic driving. Tight blind bends and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country, roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely that permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-permits\">Travel Permits</h3>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave Asmara and the surrounding province of zoba Maekel. There are checkpoints outside of Asmara where your travel permit will be checked. Those working outside Asmara also need a travel permit to leave their area of residence or work. Applications in Asmara are handled by the relevant Ministry. For business travellers, applications are dealt with by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Applications outside Asmara are handled by the local Zoba (Region) Administration Offices. Permission may take several days to be granted and is sometimes refused or delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists wishing to travel outside Asmara should apply for a travel permit at the Ministry of Tourism located on Harnet Avenue in Asmara. Processing usually takes around 24 hours. When applying for permission to travel outside of Asmara, you should supply details of the car you\u2019ll be travelling in. There have been reports of tourists not being permitted to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara and have to rent a car or use a private taxi.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on travel by foreign nationals apply equally to foreign diplomats. Staff from the British Embassy are therefore unable to easily provide consular assistance to British nationals outside of Asmara.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> lists all known airlines in Eritrea that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Mariners must seek permissions and entry visas before attempting to land in Eritrea.  This includes all islands in the Red Sea that belong to Eritrea. There have been cases of mariners being detained in the last 3 years for ignoring this.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea. Those landing without a permit have previously been detained.</p>\n\n<p>Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant.</p>\n\n<p>Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue.</p>\n\n<p>The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.  For more information and advice, see our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">Piracy and armed robbery at sea</a> page.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-assistance\">Consular Assistance</h3>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance easily to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area.</p>\n\n<p>There are obstacles to the provision of consular assistance even in Asmara. The Eritrean authorities may not inform the relevant Embassy if a foreign national is in need of help and there have been recent instances where the Eritrean authorities have refused consular access to detained foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to gain consular access to, or obtain information on dual nationals if detained by the authorities or otherwise in need of assistance.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you\u2019ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call the British Embassy on +291 1 202 838.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000.</p>\n\n<p>If you need advice which is not covered by reading our travel advice then you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Ethiopia&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Addis%20Ababa\">contact us online</a>.</p>\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-doctors/eritrea-list-of-medical-facilities\">list of Eritrea medical facilities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a limited range of medicines available in Eritrea, and many available are produced locally. If you\u2019re taking prescription medicines, you should\u00a0make sure\u00a0that you have a sufficient supply for the length of your stay in Eritrea and to manage any unforeseen events.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 122244 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company.
