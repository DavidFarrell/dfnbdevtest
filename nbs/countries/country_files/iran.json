The application process for an Iranian visa can be long and unpredictable.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you want to travel to Iran with a British passport, the Iranian Embassy has told <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> that to get a visa you must either apply as part of an organised tour, or have a sponsor in Iran. Check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://london.mfa.ir/en\">Iranian Embassy in the UK</a> for more information.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals have had problems getting visas from private online visa agencies.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you submit your visa application.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/107/iran#Vaccine-recommendations\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Iran guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Dual nationals are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities. All Iranian nationals must travel to and from Iran using an Iranian passport.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You may also be required to demonstrate to the Iranian airport authorities that you have the right to enter the UK. You must be able to produce your British passport or a valid UK visa in your Iranian passport on request. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to question you. The Iranian authorities have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"being-considered-an-iranian-national\">Being considered an Iranian national\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Even if you do not consider yourself Iranian, you may be seen as an Iranian national by Iranian authorities. For example, if your father is Iranian, or if you\u2019re married to an Iranian man.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Iran.

This is assumed to be the case by Iranian immigration authorities unless the father has petitioned the court, or the court has ruled to prevent the children travelling.

If you\u2019re a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited in Iran. In an emergency, for example if there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it is extremely unlikely that the British government will able to evacuate you or provide face-to-face assistance in Iran. In these situations, it may become more difficult to leave safely. Air, sea and land routes are under the control of the Iranian authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Assume that no face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency situation and that the British government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"arbitrary-arrest-and-detention\">Arbitrary arrest and detention\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There is a very high risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention for British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the authorities to question you. If you\u2019re detained in Iran, you could face months or years of imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a British-Iranian dual national and you are detained in Iran, the authorities will not tell\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202for grant\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0access to see you.\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr> may also not be able to visit you to provide consular support for long periods.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>British-Iranian dual nationals have been arbitrarily detained in Iran and made to serve long prison sentences. In January 2023, a British national was executed after receiving the death penalty. Iran has arrested and detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process in these cases falls below international standards.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re detained in Iran your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who show a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. As a result, consular assistance to British nationals in Iran is extremely limited.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have accused people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are in or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Mass arrests, including of bystanders, happen often. It is difficult to predict where protests will take place, and they may turn violent. British nationals arrested in connection with protests may come under added suspicion of espionage or working to undermine the Iranian government. This can increase the risk of lengthy detention, criminal charges or receiving the death penalty.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You may also come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with Iranians who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Even if you avoid protests and crowds, there is still a very high risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention. In all cases of detention, <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fhas serious concerns that the judicial process falls below international standards.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"links-to-the-uk\">Links to the UK\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>While having British connections can be reason enough for the authorities to be suspicious of your activities, you are at even greater risk if you are involved in:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>civil societies (including labour unions, human rights groups or political activist groups)\u00a0</li>\n  <li>journalism\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>academia\u00a0</li>\n  <li>any organisation perceived as anti-Iranian (either within Iran or elsewhere)\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>any institution based in the UK that receives public funds from or which have perceived links to, the British government\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>historic or current social media activism related to protest movements in Iran\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are more at risk during times of terrorist incidents, national unrest, or when there is an increase in tensions between Iran and the international community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Border areas are sensitive. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fadvises all British nationals already residing in Iran against all travel:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 100km of the Iran-Afghanistan border\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>within 10km of the entire Iran-Iraq border\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>to the provinces of Sistan and Baluchistan \u00a0</li>\n  <li>to the area east of Bam and Jask, including Bam\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is risk of banditry in the area east of Bam, Jask, and Sistan and Baluchistan. This is the main route for drug traffickers from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The towns of Zahedan, Zabol and Mirjaveh are particularly insecure.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some Iranian officials and media reports have falsely alleged a UK connection to anti-government groups in Khuzestan, Kurdish-majority regions, and Sistan and Baluchistan. If you travel to these areas against our advice, stick to the main routes to avoid accidentally entering restricted or military zones.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime and petty theft. Avoid carrying large amounts of money and keep your passport safe.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There have been some attacks and robberies targeted at foreigners and tourists, including attempted robberies by thieves posing as policemen, usually in civilian clothing. If you\u2019re approached by anyone who claims to be a policeman, ask to see ID and request the presence of a uniformed officer or marked patrol car. Do not hand over documents or cash, or get into a vehicle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>Getting cash in Iran is extremely difficult. Non-Iranian debit and cash cards will not work in Iran. It\u2019s usually not possible to change travellers cheques.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to change money on the street. You can exchange selected foreign currencies in some exchange bureaux, though you may have problems changing money. Euros and US dollars are more commonly accepted than British pounds.</p>\n\n<p>Find out before travelling how you will get enough Iranian rials for your visit legally. If you cannot, you may need to reconsider your travel plans.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surrogacy-and-adoption\">Surrogacy and adoption\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re visiting Iran to arrange an international surrogacy or adoption, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you\u2019re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process\u00a0</li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Iranian and\u202fUK\u202flaws before making any arrangements\u00a0</li>\n  <li>read\u202f<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr>\u202fand Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Iran to the\u202fUK, you must \u202f<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need an Iranian birth certificate for this. It\u2019s not possible for British nationals or dual nationals to apply for a UK passport in Iran.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Iran in 2024 is likely start on 10 March and last for 30 days until 8 April. During this time, do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening\u00a0</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. In public places women must cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor-length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic or coat that reaches to mid-thigh or knee. Men should wear long trousers and long-sleeved shirts in public.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are extra dress requirements at religious sites. Women may be asked to put on a chador (a garment that covers the whole body except the face) before entering.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-between-men-and-women\">Relationships between men and women\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Adultery and sex outside marriage are illegal under Iranian law and carry the death penalty.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Relationships between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal, although few Westerners have been prosecuted. If a Muslim woman is found in a relationship with a non-Muslim man, she may be sentenced to be whipped.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Unmarried partners and friends of the opposite sex travelling together should exercise extreme caution. Sex outside marriage and same-sex relations are against the law in Iran, with the death penalty as the defined punishment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Iranian hotel managers could insist on seeing a marriage certificate before allowing couples to share a hotel room.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-relationships\">LGBT+ relationships\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are illegal under Iranian law and can carry the death penalty.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-travellers\">Female travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Women should take extra care, particularly when travelling alone or with friends of the opposite sex. Women face a range of issues, from enforced hijab wearing to harassment due to there being relatively few foreign women in Iran. Respect local customs and avoid isolated areas. See more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"films-and-magazines\">Films and magazines\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Many western streaming services including Netflix and Prime are illegal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or drink alcohol in Iran. This is on religious grounds, with exceptions only for certain recognised Iranian religious minorities. Drinking alcohol in public is not allowed, with no exceptions. Penalties can be severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography\">Photography\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited. You can be detained and charged with breaking national security laws. Sensitive government buildings and facilities are often difficult to identify. Take extreme care when taking photographs in any area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted, especially if it contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on serious criminal charges, including espionage. It\u2019s better to ask before taking photographs of people.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs\">Illegal drugs\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or consume drugs in Iran. Penalties for importing and possessing drugs are severe and enforced. Many people convicted of drug offences, including foreign nationals, have been executed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You must carry copies of your passport photo page and visa for identification. Make sure you have a copy of the emergency contact details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"satellite-phones-and-drones\">Satellite phones and drones\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need permission from the Iranian authorities to import or use equipment like drones or satellite phones. Using them without permission is illegal and you could be arrested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones-internet-access-and-communications\">Mobile phones, internet access and communications\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have blocked, significantly slowed or shut down landline, internet and mobile services without warning in the past. This can be nationwide or localised. This can affect communication and location services on smartphones and other devices. You should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not rely on mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps or international calls for personal safety\u00a0</li>\n  <li>always keep an alternative means of communication and navigation with you</li>\n  <li>make sure friends and family know where you are\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-travellers\">Business travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Individuals involved in commercial disputes with Iranian companies risk being stopped from leaving the country until disputes are resolved.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Representatives of British or western companies may receive particular attention. British businesspeople travelling to Iran should take steps to protect commercially sensitive information, including password protection of electronic devices and not carrying unnecessary information. Electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u202fwhen using a UK driving licence\u202fto drive in Iran. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Iran, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Iran has a high rate of road accidents. Take great care when travelling by car or public transport and when crossing streets. If you\u2019re involved in an accident, no matter how minor, do not leave the scene.
