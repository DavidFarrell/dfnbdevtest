This can include their UK biometric residence permit card or a valid UK entry clearance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals don\u2019t need a visa to enter Morocco for the purpose of tourism for up to 90 days. British nationals who stay longer than 90 days need to go to a local police station to request an extension.</p>\n\n<p>When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped. Some travellers have experienced difficulties leaving the country because their passport has no entry stamp.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"arriving-by-private-boat\">Arriving by private boat</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re arriving by private boat, you must enter the country at a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.anp.org.ma/en/\">recognised port of entry</a>.

Moroccan authorities arrested four individuals in connection with the murders, including one who had links to \u201can extremist group\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increased threat linked to the number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh (formerly ISIL) and other extremist groups. Authorities regularly disrupt terrorist cells.</p>\n\n<p>Places at higher risk of attack include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>crowded areas</li>\n  <li>government installations</li>\n  <li>transportation networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with Western interests</li>\n  <li>areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Protective security measures, including security guards, may be present in areas, including hotels and sites popular with tourists.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>While there have been no recent kidnappings of foreign nationals in Morocco, it cannot be ruled out. There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Libya</li>\n  <li>Mauritania</li>\n  <li>groups originating in the Sahel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel illegally across the border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in the border and remote desert areas of North Africa. This has been done for financial gain and for political leverage.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have kidnapped:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>foreigners</li>\n  <li>government officials</li>\n  <li>civilians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those working in the tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is a currently a heightened chance of demonstrations and protests occurring across the country. You should avoid these gatherings, and be aware of the potential for protests to occur spontaneously. Protests can happen at short notice and are generally heavily policed. Demonstrations are mostly peaceful but there has been isolated violence. Demonstrations and protests may lead to increased travel disruption in affected areas.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any media reporting and instructions from local security authorities. Avoid political gatherings and demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"borders\">Borders</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"western-sahara\">Western Sahara</h3>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/western-sahara\">travel advice for Western Sahara</a> if you plan to travel to this disputed territory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"algerian-border\">Algerian border</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to cross an international border without authorisation. The land and maritime border between Morocco and Algeria is closed. The border is patrolled and monitored closely by the authorities. Do not attempt to cross the border.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in a boat or jet ski, ensure you know where the maritime border is and remain clearly within Moroccan waters. Ensure you have enough fuel to return to shore. As happened in August 2023, individuals entering Algerian waters illegally are likely to be intercepted and investigated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of violent crime occasionally happen. There have been incidents involving the use of knives against tourists in street attacks, thefts and burglaries in major cities and along beaches. Avoid quiet areas, particularly after dark. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"petty-crime\">Petty crime</h3>\n\n<p>Petty crime is common, especially in tourist areas like the medina quarter (historical district) of towns/cities and on beaches. Crimes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>pickpocketing</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>bag snatching</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>drive-by motorcycle theft of visible jewellery and handbags</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be vigilant when asking for directions and using ATMs as crime and aggressive begging can happen. Credit card fraud and scams like substituting inferior goods for those that were bought are common. Remain alert to potential confidence tricks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"harassment-of-tourists\">Harassment of tourists</h2>\n\n<p>Harassment of tourists by people posing as official tourist guides is common.</p>\n\n<p>When visiting the medina quarter (historical district) of a town or city, make sure any guide you use is operating with the agreement of the local tourist authorities, and displays an official badge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"marriage-fraud\">Marriage fraud</h2>\n\n<p>Be cautious when travelling to Morocco for a relationship, or to meet someone you met on the internet. There have been incidents of marriage fraud and attempted extortion affecting British nationals. Make sure you keep your return ticket, passport and personal belongings safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"islamic-laws-and-customs\">Islamic laws and customs</h3>\n\n<p>Morocco is a Muslim country, which follows Islamic laws and customs. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be aware of your actions to ensure they don\u2019t offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas (see below)</li>\n  <li>respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions</li>\n  <li>avoid public displays of affection, particularly outside the main tourist areas and near religious places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sexual relations outside marriage are punishable by law. Hotels can ask couples to show evidence of marriage while checking-in and, if you don\u2019t have proof, they can insist on separate rooms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country, check when Ramadan is in Morocco before you go. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that doesn\u2019t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is illegal in Morocco. Be sensitive to local laws and customs and avoid public displays of affection. Complaints can lead to prosecution. See FCDO\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a> .</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"women-travellers\">Women travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Women, especially when travelling alone, may receive unwanted attention from men.  Consider wearing loose-fitting clothing which cover the arms, legs and chest.
