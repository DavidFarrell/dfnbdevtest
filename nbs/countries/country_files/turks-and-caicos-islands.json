However, since September 2022, the level of gun crime on  Providenciales, the first point of arrival into the Turks and Caicos Islands for most visitors and the territory\u2019s economic hub, has been significantly higher than normal in concentrated known hotspots, mainly away from tourist areas. Whilst risks are lower in tourist areas you should take local advice and be aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Most crime tends to be as a result of opportunistic burglary and theft, although an increase in more serious robberies against individuals has been reported. Victims of robberies may suffer injuries if they resist. Safeguard your possessions and take normal precautions to ensure your personal safety, including when using ATM machines, especially at night. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and valuables. Take particular care of your passport as this can\u2019t be replaced locally. Use hotel safety deposit facilities where possible. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community-Organization/Crime-Stoppers-Turks-Caicos-107118949344740/\">Turks and Caicos crime-stoppers</a> website for more crime prevention tips.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you go to isolated spots or remote islands, or go diving/snorkelling, leave details of your trip and an expected time of return with a friend, relative, or hotel receptionist.  Avoid isolated spots and unlit roads at night.</p>\n\n<p>Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations on the principal islands. Charges may be applied per person.  Clarify the fare with the driver before beginning a journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>You can drive using a British Driving Licence or an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/\">International Driving Permit</a> for a period of one month. After this you should get a local licence from the Department of Road Safety.</p>\n\n<p>Most hire cars and jeeps are imported from the US and so are left-hand drive even though driving is on the left (as in the UK). Remember to drive on the left. Observe speed limits (20mph in town, and 40mph elsewhere). Don\u2019t drink and drive. Use seat belts on all journeys. Accidents, sometimes serious, are on the increase on the Leeward Highway (Providenciales), especially at night. Be aware of cyclists and, even, cars driving at night without lights.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency-assistance\">Emergency assistance</h3>\n<p>The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British Overseas Territory so does not have formal British consular representation.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can\u2019t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can\u2019t offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist\">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-versions-of-fcdo-travel-advice\">Previous versions of <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a previous version of the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\">National Archives website</a>.
