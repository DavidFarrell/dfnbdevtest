Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified St Vincent and the Grenadines as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/211/st-vincent-and-the-grenadines#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Mosquito-borne diseases, such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/chikungunya-fever.aspx\">Chikungunya virus</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/13/dengue\">Dengue fever</a> are present in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Dengue fever is endemic to Latin America and the Caribbean and can occur throughout the year. In September 2020, an upturn in Dengue fever cases was reported. You should take steps to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>. In view of a current local shortage in mosquito repellent, you may wish to bring your own with you.</p>\n\n<p>The main government hospital can cope with many types of treatment but serious cases may mean emergency evacuation.</p>\n\n<p>Medical treatment in St Vincent and the Grenadines can be expensive. Make sure that you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment. Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, you should check their policies on pre-payment. Private clinics may not accept medical travel insurance as payment for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).</p>\n",
