Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. There is a real risk to life.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the war, your activities may amount to offences under UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK. British nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured. British nationals undertaking humanitarian work have also been detained by Russian authorities. The risk to life, or of mistreatment, is high. Our ability to provide consular support in these circumstances is very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of the Ukrainian authorities while you remain in Ukraine. Check the rules of martial law in your location. These will vary from region to region. Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks, including the impact of the invasion in your area. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Take extra care while moving around.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you know what curfews are in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Before the invasion, serious crime against foreigners was relatively rare, but incidents did occur, with some cases being racially motivated.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of crime, report it to the police by calling 102.  <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-list-of-interpreters\">a list of local translators in Ukraine</a>.

Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of and from vehicles is common. Do not leave documents or money in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Cloning of credit and debit cards is common. Be aware of who is around you when using ATMs and do not let your card out of your sight during transactions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times to use as identification and to demonstrate your legal status in Ukraine if asked by the police. Police should identify themselves and show identification. If you\u2019re detained because you have not been able to present your passport, ask for an official report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-to-money\">Access to money</h3>\n\n<p>ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used in cities. However, as a result of the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia, ATMs might not be refilled with cash and some bank cards might not be accepted. Make sure you have sufficient cash in local currency. US dollars and euros are the easiest currencies to exchange in Ukraine. You may be able to exchange sterling, but in fewer places. Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not accepted. Only use official exchange booths and make sure you\u2019re given a receipt. You\u2019ll need to present your passport to exchange currency worth 150,000 Ukrainian hryvnia or more. You\u2019ll need the receipt to exchange money back on departure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-and-smoking\">Alcohol and smoking</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to smoke or drink alcohol in public places, including on public transport, at bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs near government or military establishments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Although same-sex relationships are not illegal, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and showing affection in public may receive negative attention. There\u2019s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

Because of security challenges in Ukraine, we currently advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements there.</p>\n\n<p>Children born through surrogacy are not automatically entitled to British nationality and therefore a British travel document. We cannot confirm which Ukrainian lawyers are offering services, due to the ongoing invasion.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine. Plan appropriately for the time you will need to spend in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement with a Ukrainian woman in another country, you should read about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas/surrogacy-overseas\">surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A surrogacy arrangement in a country near Ukraine must comply with the law of that country, not Ukrainian law. In some other countries, surrogacy arrangements may, in certain circumstances, be illegal.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly advise you to seek specialist independent UK and in-country legal advice before changing arrangements.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-information-and-risks\">Transport information and risks</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expect disruption to travel and transport networks. Only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. We cannot confirm which services below are operating. Where possible, check before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Ukraine, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/ukraine/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Roads are of variable quality and routes may be affected by the ongoing invasion. Avoid night-time travel wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Local driving standards are poor. Street lights are weak and speed limits, traffic lights and road signs are often ignored. Drivers frequently do not indicate before manoeuvring. There are a high number of traffic accidents, including fatalities. Speeding, drink driving and infrequent use of helmets, seat belts and child restraints in vehicles are the main contributing factors.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a road accident, you must wait for the police to assess the accident. Call the police on 102. Local officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>You must wear a seat belt.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive with any alcohol content in your blood.</p>\n\n<p>Police can stop vehicles and give fines for minor offences such as illegal parking or jumping a red light. They may carry a credit card terminal to collect payment on the spot, or fines can be paid online or at a bank within 15 days. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://police.kiev.ua/statti/203-yak-splatiti-shtraf-pdr\">payment options</a> (in Ukrainian). The police officer should give their name and rank, explain why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report. The police may film interactions with members of the public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You must have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well as your UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Ukraine. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.

A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry original vehicle registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers at all times. You must show them when crossing borders and if you are stopped by the police. This also applies to rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire</h3>\n\n<p>If you intend to rent a vehicle for your travel in Ukraine, check with the car hire company and insurance company about their policy on renting cars in Ukraine and any other country you will pass through, especially non-EU countries. Ensure they provide you with a rental agreement permitting you to cross the Ukrainian border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leaving-ukraine-by-car\">Leaving Ukraine by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can leave Ukraine by car through most border crossing points, but Ukraine\u2019s border crossings with Russia and Belarus are closed to regular traffic.</p>\n\n<p>There could be long queues at the border crossing points with EU member states and Moldova.

The service <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://Tabletki.ua\">Tabletki.ua</a> is continuing to operate and tries to maintain hourly updates about availability of medicines nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacies may close without notice. Maintain a stock of essential medication. Pharmacies in smaller towns may not have the same variety of medications available in the bigger cities. Pharmacies are usually easily identifiable by the presence of a green cross or the word \u2018apteka\u2019 (\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430).
