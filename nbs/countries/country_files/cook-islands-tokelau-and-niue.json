In Niue, you must apply for a local driving licence from the Police Department. Distances around the three Atolls of Tokelau are short and can be covered by boat and on foot.</p>\n\n<p>Driving on islands in the South Pacific can be challenging, particularly at night. Road conditions and street lighting are poor and there are few footpaths.  Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.</p>\n\n<p>The legal blood alcohol limit for drivers and motorcyclists in the Cook Islands is 0.08. Do not drink and drive.

Talk to your travel insurer to check your insurance policy covers such activity and seek advice on any restrictions that may apply. You should wear a helmet when using motorbikes or scooters.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming, snorkelling and diving are common activities. Take local advice before swimming. At certain times of the year, some beaches in Niue are closed for traditional fishing activities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n<p>Maritime safety is a concern in some Pacific countries. The safety standards you might expect of transport operators in the UK may not be replicated in the Pacific. Sufficient safety equipment may not be provided and safety regulations are not always adhered to. Ferries are often overcrowded.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau follows New Zealand maritime standards.

This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cook Islands.</p>\n\n<p>A list of accidents and incidents in the region can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/\">Aviation Safety Network website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is no airport on Tokelau. Access is by boat only.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n<p>The Cook Islands are a Parliamentary democracy based on the UK model. Officially the Islands are an independent nation in free association with New Zealand, which  means the Cook Islands government has full executive powers.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau is a dependent territory of New Zealand. It has its own unique political institutions, including a national legislative body and an Executive Council. It runs its own elections every three years. The relationship between Tokelau and New Zealand is managed by the Administrator of Tokelau. This is a statutory position held by a New Zealand public servant, and appointed by the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Niue\u2019s system of government is based on the Westminster system. The Niue Assembly consists of 20 members, 14 of whom are elected by village constituencies and 6 from the common roll. The 20 members elect a Premier and the Premier selects three cabinet ministers from the 19. Members elect a Speaker from outside their ranks. A general election is held every three years.</p>\n\n<p>The political situation across the islands is generally calm.</p>\n\n",

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance</a> page. Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-facilities\">Medical facilities</h2>\n\n<p>Medical facilities in the Cook Islands and the islands of Niue and Tokelau are limited. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to mainland New Zealand is likely to be the only option for treatment. Make sure your insurance policy includes provision for medical evacuation and covers you for all eventualities, including for any pre-existing conditions and any adventure or watersports activities within your travel plans.</p>\n\n<p>Hospitals may not be as well-equipped as those in United Kingdom and may lack specialist equipment (including neo-natal equipment for premature babies).  Hospital payment may be required before any treatment is received. Outside the capital there may be limited capacity to respond to emergency situations. Not all Pacific islands have diver decompression chambers and divers needing emergency treatment may need medical evacuation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"health-risks\">Health risks</h2>\n<p>There is a risk of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue. You should take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Check the relevant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/264/cook-islands-niue-tokelau\">TravelHealthPro country page</a> for more information and advice.</p>\n\n<p>Ciguatera is an illness caused by eating fish containing certain toxins. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes and sometimes serious illness. There is no way to tell whether fish has been contaminated, but reef fish tend to concentrate the toxins more than others. Deep water fish like tuna, mahi mahi or wahoo are better options.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"water\">Water</h2>\n<p>In the Cook Islands, Rarotonga and Aitutaki have reticulated water supply systems.  Water usage is not charged. On the other islands of the Southern Group, limited reticulation is provided and augmented by rainwater catchment and storage. The atolls of the Northern Group rely on rainwater from roof catchments.</p>\n\n<p>Tokelau and Niue\u2019s water supply is still at the household level. Rainwater harvesting from roofs is the primary source of water in Tokelau.  Boiling water and only drinking bottled water is strongly recommended.</p>\n\n",

On average, there are around nine tropical cyclones each season, some of which can be expected to be classified as \u2018severe\u2019 (category 3 or higher).</p>\n\n<p>You should monitor local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel.
