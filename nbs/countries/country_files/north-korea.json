Those that do are usually part of an organised tour. If you decide to visit North Korea, follow the advice of your tour group and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your personal safety at risk.</p>\n\n<p>The North Korean authorities have reportedly detained some foreign nationals and denied them access to consular support.</p>\n\n<p>While daily life in the capital city Pyongyang may appear calm, the security situation can change quickly with no advance warning about possible actions by the authorities. This poses significant risks to British visitors and residents.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the political and security situation very closely and stay in touch with your host organisation or tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"current-incidents-and-risks\">Current incidents and risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"covid-19-lockdown\">COVID-19 lockdown</h3>\n\n<p>No entry into North Korea is permitted while COVID-19 border restrictions remain in place. The North Korean government continues to temporarily suspend all passenger routes into and out of North Korea. The British Embassy in Pyongyang is temporarily closed due to these restrictions. This means you cannot get consular support from within North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot enter or leave North Korea through the border with South Korea without special permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nuclear-testing\">Nuclear testing</h3>\n\n<p>The level of tension on the Korean peninsula has remained high since 2017 when North Korea began a series of nuclear and missile tests.</p>\n\n<p>A halt in nuclear testing and ballistic missile tests, announced in April 2018, came to an end in May 2019.

If you\u2019re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (<abbr title=\"Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\">DPRK</abbr>)    in London  by email at <a href=\"mailto:prkinfo@yahoo.com\">prkinfo@yahoo.com</a>, or by telephone on 020 8992 4965 .</p>\n\n<p>Tourists can normally only travel to North Korea as part of an organised tour. Independent travellers will need a sponsor and permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is usually only possible for business travellers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19-rules\">COVID-19 rules</h2>\n\n<p>No entry into North Korea is permitted whilst COVID-19 border restrictions remain in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You will need a visa to enter North Korea. For further information contact the Embassy of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (<abbr title=\"Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\">DPRK</abbr>) in London by email at <a href=\"mailto:prkinfo@yahoo.com\">prkinfo@yahoo.com</a>, or by telephone on 020 8992 4965.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p>Visa application enquires should be made directly to the embassy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At   least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/119/north-korea\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s North Korea guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registration-with-the-authorities\">Registration with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>You must register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if your visit is for more than 24 hours. Most hotels will automatically complete this process on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Some hotels may insist on full cash payment in advance when you check in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>You must leave any Global Positioning System technology with North Korean customs. You can collect your devices when you leave North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>You can bring a foreign mobile phone into the country, but you must register it at the border. You can only use it with a North Korean SIM card.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid bringing books or other written material in the Korean language, including anything with religious content. Consider carefully any films or television programmes that you bring into the country, either on DVD or on data storage devices. Any literature or media deemed to have an anti-government message or deemed subversive or pornographic by the authorities in North Korea risk confiscation, with severe penalties including imprisonment as a result.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been cases of travel guides being confiscated at the airport on arrival; they are usually returned on departure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-money-into-north-korea\">Taking money into North Korea</h2>\n\n<p>Shops and restaurants list prices in the local currency (North Korean won) but usually charge foreigners in foreign currency. They convert the won price using official exchange rates.</p>\n\n<p>The euro and US dollar are the most widely accepted currencies, although some places accept Chinese yuan.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import and export the local currency. There are no restrictions on importing and exporting foreign currency, but you must declare it at customs. Credit cards and travellers cheques are not accepted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n",

A halt in nuclear testing and ballistic missile tests, announced in April 2018, came to an end in May 2019, when the North and South Korean governments temporarily restored direct contact. North Korea and the United States also restored contact at this time.</p>\n\n<p>North Korea resumed missile tests in 2019, after the breakdown of the Hanoi Summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un. North Korea has tested ballistic missiles frequently since 2019.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, similar periods of diplomatic engagement have not lasted. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests and a return to instability in the region. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises, often held in the spring and autumn.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime against foreigners in North Korea is rare. Take sensible precautions to protect your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fire-safety\">Fire safety</h2>\n\n<p>Levels of fire safety awareness may be low. You may wish to check hotel fire procedures or consult your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Insults or jokes about the North Korean political system and its leadership are severely frowned upon. Foreigners have sometimes found themselves in trouble for not paying what was deemed to be a sufficient level of respect, including not treating images of the leader with care.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the North Korean authorities have arrested some visitors on various or unspecified grounds, including 4 US citizens and 1 Canadian. Some have faced public trials.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016 a US national was sentenced to 15 years hard labour after a conviction for crimes against the state. He was found to have attempted to steal a political banner from the staff quarters of a tourist hotel. When he was released in 2017, he was in a coma and died soon after his return to the US.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h2>\n\n<p>Offences that would be considered trivial in other countries can incur very severe penalties in North Korea, particularly actions the authorities deem to be disrespectful towards the North Korean leadership or government.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>Ask permission before taking photographs. Avoid taking photographs of North Korean officials or guarded buildings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Although there\u2019s no specific legislation outlawing same sex relationships in North Korea, these are considered unacceptable by the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-outside-pyongyang\">Travel outside Pyongyang</h2>\n\n<p>Foreigners living in Pyongyang are usually able to travel within the city, but will often require permission for travel outside Pyongyang.</p>\n\n<p>Travel for visitors within North Korea is severely restricted. Whether you are visiting on business or as a tourist, a guide will almost always accompany you. The guide will decide where you can go. It is your guide\u2019s responsibility to get permission to travel outside Pyongyang. Military checkpoints at the entry and exit to all towns usually include ID checks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 guards shot and killed a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted military area. Remain in permitted areas and move away immediately if asked to do so by North Korean officials.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You can get taxis from hotels or outside department stores, but they will be reluctant to take you without a local guide or interpreter. Foreigners are not generally allowed on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>International driving permits are not valid in North Korea. Foreigners living in North Korea must get a local driving licence by passing a local driving test. You should take extra care when driving, as roads are often of poor quality with frequent hazards, and pedestrian road safety awareness is low.</p>\n\n<p>See more information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Most travellers enter North Korea on direct flights from Beijing to Pyongyang operated by the North Korean national airline Air Koryo or Air China.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fuk-air-safety-list&amp;data=05%7C01%7CFlora.Death%40fcdo.gov.uk%7Ca453c874a6bd49fe7d3608db5522f725%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C638197381224386573%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RT1Kf6OhMx9SCkt5sDIj4jc6%2BYEpJtla4x%2BAGUNjiCM%3D&amp;reserved=0\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) has banned Air Koryo from operating commercial air services to the UK, with the exception of 2 Tupolev Tu204 aircraft.
