Your final vaccine dose must be at least 14 days prior to travel. If you cannot produce one, customs and immigration officials have the authority to ask you to take a COVID test.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors arriving with COVID-19 will be responsible for all treatment costs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"departure-rules\">Departure rules</h3>\n\n<p>The official policy is still that unvaccinated individuals have to take an <abbr title=\"Antigen test kit\">ATK</abbr>   test no more than 48 hours before departure. There are reports of this not being enforced. However, customs and immigration officials have the authority to ask you for a pre-departure test.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>Your passport should have an \u2018expiry date\u2019 at least 6 months after the day you enter Laos.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines only allow boarding of flights to and from   Laos if you have 2 blank pages in your passport.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p>Visa on arrival is available at Vientiane\u2019s Wattay International Airport, and    Luang Prabang\u2019s airport, but not at all land borders. You need to confirm in advance before attempting to cross.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://laoevisa.gov.la/index\">apply online for an e-Visa</a> - you must submit your application at least 3 days in advance of your entry to Laos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visa-extensions\">Visa extensions</h3>\n\n<p>Tourist visas will only be extended twice in Laos. Be aware if you do not renew your visa within 90 days, you will face a fine of 20 million kip, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Laos.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://immigration.gov.la/require-for-working-investing-and-studying-in-lao/\">Lao immigration department\u2019s entry requirements</a>  .</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements\">Vaccination requirements</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/124/laos\">vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Laos guide</a>    .</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of country.

You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Keep yourself informed of local developments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Petty crime can occur in tourist areas and around ATMs. Try to have someone with you and do not carry passport, bank cards and cash in the same bag.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers regularly report random bag snatches, often by people on motorcycles. Hold your bags on the side away from the road, and do not have valuables on display.</p>\n\n<p>People have reported incidents where they are approached and followed when alone. Be alert to your surroundings, trust your instincts and if you think you\u2019re being followed move to an area where there are other people. Consider sharing your planned route in advance and avoid quiet or sparsely travelled areas.</p>\n\n<p>Safes in hotels and guesthouses are not necessarily secure. Use your own lock where possible. Take care of your possessions if you\u2019re travelling overnight, on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly vigilant travelling at night by bicycle or motorcycle. Stick to well-used, well-lit roads and carry a personal alarm if possible, especially if you\u2019re alone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorcycle-scams\">Motorcycle scams</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave your passport as a deposit or guarantee when hiring motorcycles. There have been reports of rental companies arranging for their motorcycles to be deliberately stolen from you or damaged, then keeping passports and demanding high fees. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical and other costs that arise from motorcycle accidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>Call the Tourist Police in Vientiane on 021 251 128.</p>\n\n<p>Local law enforcement responses to crimes, even violent crimes, are often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have reported finding police stations closed, emergency telephone numbers unanswered, or police with no transport or authorisation to investigate crimes at night. If the police do attend, they may ask you to pay fuel and telephone costs. Ask the staff at your accommodation for help with reporting a crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Both male and female tourists have reported having their drink or food spiked with drugs and in some cases been assaulted. Never leave food or drink unattended. Be cautious about accepting drinks from strangers at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-the-death-penalty\">Illegal drugs and the death penalty</h3>\n\n<p>The possession and use of all drugs including marijuana are illegal in Laos and penalties are harsh. These include life sentences and the death penalty, with a number of Lao nationals having been sentenced to death in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>For confidential support and guidance for dealing with officials, call the British Embassy in Vientiane (24 hours).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Photographing or entering any military site without an official invitation is prohibited and you may be arrested or detained. Avoid photographing bridges or airfields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-lao-nationals\">Relationships with Lao nationals</h3>\n\n<p>The Lao government prohibits sexual relationships between foreign and Lao nationals, except when the parties have been married in accordance with Lao family law. You must ask permission for marriage or engagement to a Lao national in a formal application to the Lao authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for failing to register such a relationship can be up to 5,000 US dollars fine and possible imprisonment. It is not unknown for Lao authorities to demand entry into hotel rooms or guesthouses where they suspect this regulation is being broken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes</h3>\n\n<p>When you visit any temples and religious sites, your shoulders and knees should be covered, whether you are male or female.</p>\n\n<p>It is not considered appropriate to walk around in public wearing swimming costumes after leaving waterfalls, rivers or swimming pools.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations in Laos. Proud To Be Us Laos raises awareness about LGBT+ rights and HIV/AIDS among the LGBT+ community.  More information can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/proudtobeuslaos/\">Proud To Be Us Laos Facebook page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"river-rafting-and-water-activities\">River rafting and water activities</h3>\n\n<p>Travel on the Mekong River by speedboat and even slow boat can be dangerous, especially when water levels are low and sandbanks may be close to the surface. Make sure you travel with a company that provides lifejackets.</p>\n\n<p>White-water rafting, kayaking, tubing and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous and there have been incidents of drowning and serious injuries. Operators may not give the necessary safety advice and you cannot expect warning signs to tell you about currents or rough stretches of water. Take great care and check your travel insurance covers you for these activities. Make use of buoyancy aids and if none are available reconsider whether you want to take part.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0a 1949 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Laos. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Laos, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>. Roads in Laos are in poor condition and vehicles are not maintained to UK standards. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident, as vehicles often do not have lights. Livestock including water buffalo also stray on to the roads causing accidents.</p>\n\n<p>The recently opened Vientiane to Vang Vieng section of the China-Laos Expressway is the first contained high-speed road in Laos, with posted speed limits between 80 and 120km/h. Take care when using this road, as some local users will be unfamiliar with this type of carriageway.</p>\n\n<p>Motorbike rentals may not supply helmets, so budget to purchase one locally. Take extra care when using public transport or shared vehicles, as they can be overcrowded and unsafe. You can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a road accident you will have to pay compensation for third-party property damage and injury, even if you\u2019re not at fault. As a general rule, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.</p>\n\n<p>You should get permission from the local district authorities for any travel seen as out of the ordinary, such as extensive photography, or scientific research of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>Police may stop you at any time, particularly in the evening, and ask for ID. You should stop at checkpoints and roadblocks unless you are waved on.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"anti-personnel-mines\">Anti-personnel mines</h3>\n\n<p>Mines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard throughout Laos and kill a number of people each year. Keep to main routes in rural areas, and do not pick up metal objects. This risk is higher after flash floods or landslides during the monsoon season.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to October, at the same time as the typhoon season in south-east Asia. Mountain areas are vulnerable to landslides in the rainy season and the Mekong\u2019s river basins and surrounding areas are likely to be flooded  . The Mekong River Commission posts <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/\">official updates on the Mekong River</a>. Travel to some provinces can be seriously disrupted during this time.
