You might be jetlagged and tired from your flight. Take regular rest breaks at the many rest stops on the roads.</p>\n\n<p>Australia is known for having larger distances between towns and amenities, make sure you have enough water before travelling and tell someone about your plans.</p>\n\n<p>Check road conditions before beginning your journey. Stay with your vehicle if it breaks down. Avoid travelling in extreme heat. Sudden storms and strong winds can make driving difficult. Take particular care when driving on unsealed roads, 4WD tracks and desert or beach roads. Northern Territory Police have in the past warned tourists to stay off unsealed tracks in remote areas of Central Australia following reports of stranded motorists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>You can drive in Australia using your UK driving licence as long as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you remain a temporary overseas visitor</li>\n  <li>your UK licence is valid</li>\n  <li>you have not been disqualified from driving anywhere</li>\n  <li>your licence is not suspended or cancelled, or your visiting driving privileges withdrawn</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you intend to stay in Australia and you hold a permanent visa, you can drive using your UK licence for a maximum of 3 months. To continue driving, you must get a local licence within this 3-month period.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry your driving licence and passport when driving.

Check your policy before you set off.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-laws\">Driving laws</h3>\n\n<p>Driving laws and regulations differ in each state and territory. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. The penalties can be severe.

Ensure you have a roadworthy vehicle fitted with GPS and 2 spare tyres. Take good maps and extra food, water and fuel. Plan your route carefully and get local advice before you set out. Leave your route details and expected time of return with the local tourist authorities, police, your hotel or hostel, or friends and relatives, and let them know when you\u2019ve arrived safely.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-on-kgari-fraser-island\">Driving on K\u2019gari (Fraser Island)</h3>\n\n<p>Following a number of serious accidents, all vehicles on K\u2019gari (Fraser Island) must keep to a maximum speed of 80km per hour on beaches and 30km per hour in towns. 4WD vehicles must have no more than 8 occupants (including the driver) and you must store all luggage inside the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid driving at night and be aware of beach hazards like ditches created by the surf. K\u2019gari is remote and emergency services can take many hours to reach an accident. Carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and personal medication as there is no pharmacy on the island.
