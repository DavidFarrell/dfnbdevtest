Remaining within Petra outside of these hours is not permitted and could lead to arrest and prosecution. Ticket prices are displayed and anyone needing clarification should ask the tourist office staff before agreeing any additional charges.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime levels are generally low: most crime is limited to pick-pocketing, occasional bag snatching and theft from cars. Be vigilant and keep your money, passport and valuables secure.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst large numbers of foreigners enjoy visiting Amman and hiking in some of Jordan\u2019s more remote areas, women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. On occasion this can escalate and in recent years there has been an increase in reports of cases of sexual assault. Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone even during daylight hours. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK. See these <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">tips for women travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Jordanian police advise anyone who finds themselves stranded - even in daytime - to call the police on 911.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tribal-violence\">Tribal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Disputes between tribes, families, or other social disputes may develop without notice and sometimes involve violence and the use of firearms. You should follow news reports and, if caught in an incident, leave the area and follow any police instructions given.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t accept lifts from strangers. If you have to use a taxi ask your hotel to recommend a reliable driver. Women shouldn\u2019t ride in the front seat of a taxi, particularly when travelling alone.</p>\n\n<p>Always keep your ID documents with you. You can drive in Jordan using an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a>. Make sure you have third party insurance. In Jordanian law a driver is always considered guilty if they hit a pedestrian. If you\u2019re involved in such an incident, you could face imprisonment and be liable for the payment of hospital bills and other compensation.</p>\n\n<p>In the rainy season (approx. November-March), the Government of Jordan sometimes issues flood alerts, particularly along the Jordan valley. These could impact on drivers and those hiking. You should be alert to potential advisories which can result in diversions and road closures. In the event of an alert affecting you, you should co-operate fully with the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>According to the latest available <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/road_safety/road_traffic_deaths2/atlas.html\">World Health Organization</a> data, Jordan ranks 48th in the world for the number of deaths per population as a result of road traffic accidents. There have been a number of fatalities recently on the Desert Highway.  You should drive with care, especially at night, and avoid driving on unlit roads. Stray animals, broken-down vehicles and unmarked road works are common. If you have an accident, don\u2019t leave the scene before the police have arrived and taken a statement. You can contact the police by calling 911.</p>\n\n<p>The police carry out random security checks. Keep identification documents with you to present at these checkpoints. The police also strictly enforce the speed limit with fixed and hand-held speed traps. The speed limit in urban areas is 40km/h; 80km/h on rural roads; and 120km/h on highways. The police  issue on-the-spot fines of between 15 to 150 Jordanian Dinars.</p>\n\n<p>Front seatbelts are required by law. Failure to wear one can result in a fine. All cars must carry a fire extinguisher and warning triangle. Using a mobile phone while driving is illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Cars and coaches can become trapped by occasional heavy snowfalls in winter and roads in mountain areas, including Petra and the surrounding area, can become blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Roads may also occasionally be blocked by political protests and demonstrations. If you encounter such an incident, cooperate fully with the police and authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adventure-travel\">Adventure travel</h2>\n\n<p>Many organisations offer trips across Jordan to take advantage of the outdoor activities on offer. The quality of these tour operators varies greatly. You should ensure you are well prepared for any outdoor activities in Jordan with appropriate clothing and sufficient food and water for what can be extreme temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>There are around 80 wadis (valleys) in Jordan. During the rainy season (November to March) there\u2019s a risk of flash floods in these valleys. Before travelling to a wadi check the weather forecast and don\u2019t travel to places where heavy rain is expected for at least one day afterwards. If you\u2019re caught in a flash flood go to a high point and don\u2019t attempt to cross the water. If you\u2019re in a vehicle try to drive to a dry spot. Contact the Civil Defence on 911 if the situation continues.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering diving or snorkelling in Aqaba, be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. Never dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make bookings through your tour representative and make sure the operator is accredited with an internationally recognised scheme such as PADI.</p>\n\n",

If you\u2019re found guilty of drink driving you could face a driving ban, a fine or even imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in a lengthy prison sentence and a heavy fine.</p>\n\n<p>Although co-habitation for unmarried foreign couples isn\u2019t illegal, it may be frowned upon. Some landlords may ask if you are married or ask for a marriage certificate. Under local legislation, children with a Jordanian passport are not permitted to travel outside the country without their father\u2019s consent, even if they enter the country on a British passport.</p>\n\n<p>While Jordanian law does not explicitly prohibit homosexual acts, public displays of affection between homosexual couples are not generally tolerated. You could be arrested under other Jordanian laws. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly advise against bringing drones to Jordan. Ownership of drones is licensed and gaining a licence is a lengthy process.
