You should take a test after the 10-day period; if this is negative, you may end your isolation.</p>\n\n<p>Plan ahead and make sure you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>can access money</li>\n  <li>understand what your insurance will cover</li>\n  <li>can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-a-covid-19-test-in-mauritania\">Getting a COVID-19 test in Mauritania</h2>\n\n<p>Should you need to take a COVID-19 test while in Mauritania, for example for onward travel, the Mauritanian Ministry of Health has approved the following institutions to carry out COVID-19 testing within Mauritania:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Institut National de Recherche en Sant\u00e9 Publique (INRSP)</li>\n  <li>Institut National d\u2019h\u00e9pato-Virologie (INHV)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-in-mauritania\">Healthcare in Mauritania</h2>\n\n<p>Medical facilities are extremely limited, particularly outside Nouakchott and Nouadhibou.

You should remain vigilant at all times and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The porous nature of borders in the Sahel region - of which Mauritania is a part - means terrorist groups are able to operate across borders and carry out attacks anywhere in the region.</p>\n\n<p>As seen in Mali, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso, terrorist groups continue to mount attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafes and restaurants visited by foreigners. Be especially vigilant in these locations.</p>\n\n<p>The main threat comes from groups associated with Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeer (JNIM). JNIM formed in March 2017 following the merger of Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar-al-Dine and al-Murabitun.

This includes Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (IS-GS), who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. The kidnap threat is most significant near the Mali-Mauritania border, compared to the west of Mauritania and the capital Nouakchott where the threat is considerably lower. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the Sahel region. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",
