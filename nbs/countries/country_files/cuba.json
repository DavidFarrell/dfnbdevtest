Don\u2019t travel with anyone other than your tour operator. If you need to take a taxi from the airport, make sure it\u2019s a registered one and not a private vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Car-related crime and muggings occur from time to time, not only in Havana but also in Santiago de Cuba and other areas. Take care in central Havana at night. Use a taxi rather than walk, even if you\u2019re only a few blocks away from your destination. There have been attacks on foreigners in hire cars after their tyres have been deliberately punctured. If you get a puncture in a remote area, drive on to a town before stopping. Don\u2019t stop for hitch-hikers as they\u2019ve also been known to carry out attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of pickpockets and bag-snatchers, especially in Old Havana, on public transport, at major tourist sites and in nightclubs. Don\u2019t carry large amounts of cash, avoid wearing expensive jewellery and leave valuables in the hotel safe. Carry a copy of your passport and lock the original away. Beware of thefts from rooms, particularly in private guest houses (\u201ccasas particulares\u201d). Hi-tech items like phones and laptops are highly sought after in Cuba and are particularly attractive to thieves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors can hire cars, but  fuel shortages across Cuba can lead to tourists having difficulty acquiring petrol and diesel,  including in  Havana. You should bear that in mind if planning to travel for longer distances and consider travelling with a registered tour operator instead.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Cuba using a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months from the date of your entry into the country. Foreign residents, both permanent and temporary, who stay in Cuba for more than 6 months will need to pass a Cuban Driving test in order to get a Cuban Licence. If you rent a car make sure the insurance includes local third party cover.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst valid foreign driving licences are generally accepted, it may be advisable to obtain an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP), as 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use after this date.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>All drivers and passengers of motorcycles and scooters are required by law to wear a crash helmet. In view of serious accidents that have involved tourists, you should not use mopeds or three wheel Coco-Taxis for travel around Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are variable. Many vehicles, including public transport, are badly maintained. Roads are poorly lit and sign-posted. Beware of cyclists, potholes and cars that stop without warning to pick up hitch-hikers. Vehicles that break down are often left on the road until repairs can be made. Avoid driving at night, when animals and unlit vehicles are a real danger.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t drink and drive.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re involved in a serious traffic accident the police investigation may take several months to resolve. During this time, you will normally not be allowed to leave Cuba and may even be detained. If convicted of killing someone in a road traffic accident, you can expect to receive a very lengthy prison sentence. If you do have a serious accident, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-havana\">British Embassy</a> as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Official (yellow) taxis are generally reliable. Avoid private taxis and the older model of private cars being offered as taxis, which lack proper licensing and modern safety features.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are concerns about standards of maintenance of public transport. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CU\">Aviation Safety network</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Protests took place in Cuba in July 2021 and further protests are possible. You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of local authorities. During periods of tension, access to the internet may be blocked in some areas.</p>\n\n<p>Cuba is a one-party state. There is a high level of social control and a strong police presence. There are widespread restrictions on freedom of speech, association and assembly for Cuban nationals. Political demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government may be broken up.</p>\n\n",

The policy on importation of drones is under review and, for the time being, Cuban Customs advises visitors not to bring drones.

Cuban courts tend to hand out severe penalties for those convicted of drugs-related offences. Pack all luggage yourself and don\u2019t carry items for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Cuba prohibits the import of all meat products and fruit. If you arrive in Cuba with any meat or fruit, it will be confiscated and destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid military zones and other restricted areas. Be particularly careful when taking photographs or videos in these areas, which are not always clearly signposted.</p>\n\n<p>If you are suspected of having caused injury to someone, or broken a law, you may not be allowed to leave Cuba during the investigation and trial, and could be detained, depending on the nature of the offence.
