Specialist treatment is also available.</p>\n\n<p>You should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/\">get a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a> before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p>\n\n<p>The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. If you don\u2019t have your EHIC with you or you\u2019ve lost it, you can call the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 191 218 1999 to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. Read more about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning a permanent move to Martinique, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on\u00a0long-term entitlement as residents to health care provision under the French national system. Enquiries should be made to the DWP Overseas Medical Benefits help-line on 00 44 191 218 1999. Alternatively, information can be obtained direct from the English language service of the Caisse Primaire d\u2019Assurance Maladie (French social security service) on 00 33 8 20 90 42 12 or\u00a0CLEISS\u00a0(the Helpdesk in France for international mobility and social security) on 00 33 1 45 26 33 4.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 15 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n",
