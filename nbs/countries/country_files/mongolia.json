Watch out for pickpockets especially in markets or other crowded public places. Be wary of large groups of people, including children and teenagers, who sometimes harass pedestrians for money when entering and leaving vehicles, pubs and restaurants. Tourists\u2019 mobile phones are targeted by thieves in the street and should be carried securely. All valuables, including passports, money etc should be kept in a safe place. Do not display signs of wealth \u2013 jewellery, watches etc.</p>\n\n<p>Petty crime tends to increase during festive months \u2013 New Year, Tsagaan Sar (December \u2013 February) and Naadam (July).  Always be alert and always take precautions, especially during these months and when using Public Transport.\nThe majority of crime committed against foreign nationals in Mongolia is non-violent, although violent incidents including robberies and sexual assault do occasionally occur. There have been reports of foreigners being robbed and assaulted in Ulaanbaatar, especially when walking alone at night, or using unlicensed taxis. Take additional care if away from the city centre area.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities request all crimes be reported. This allows them to investigate and record crime in Mongolia. The Police will only require you report the crime, you are free to depart once the crime is reported.</p>\n\n<p>Report any crime to the nearest district police station. In an emergency call the police on 102 or +976 102 from an international mobile phone. There should be someone available on this number who can speak to you in English.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Travelling across the Mongolian countryside can be difficult and potentially dangerous if you are not familiar with the terrain. Mongolia does not have an extensive road network. You may need to follow tracks in the dust, mud or sand and there will not necessarily be other traffic to follow if these give out.</p>\n\n<p>People travelling in Mongolia should be aware of local road conditions, weather forecasts and have researched the areas they will travel through.   The knowledge of a local guide or driver can be an advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are large areas of the country without mobile phone coverage. It is recommended that you take back-up communications like a satellite phone, plenty of water and provisions. Make a contingency plan and make sure someone knows your route and expected times of arrival and departure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling to the more remote parts of the country and are not part of an organised group, we advise you use local guides and/or notify National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) of your plans.  NEMA has an English website on which you can email them. You are also advised to have the phone numbers for local NEMA and the Police offices in the provinces you visit.</p>\n\n<p>Mongolia is a large country with varying weather conditions, you should always follow the weather forecasts when travelling. The country experiences extremes of weather, from +35C in summer to -40C in winter. Even in summer, evenings can be cold because of the altitude. Weather conditions can change without warning. There are very long distances between settlements. Take appropriate provisions, including warm clothing, blankets, food and water if you\u2019re travelling outside urban areas. You should carry a First Aid kit and supply of prescription medicines when travelling outside Ulaanbaatar.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mongolia/health\">health</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n<p>Driving in Mongolia can be difficult and dangerous. Wear seat belts and where possible avoid driving at night. If possible, use an experienced, professional driver, familiar with the driving conditions and geography of the countryside. Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are large areas of the country without mobile phone coverage.</p>\n\n<p>Only 10% of the country\u2019s road are tarmacked and there is minimal signposting. Driving standards have not kept pace with the dramatic growth in the number of vehicles and are highly variable. Vehicle maintenance can be poor, even for rental vehicles.\nDriving in Ulaanbaatar is hazardous as roads are heavily congested. There are a high number of accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Outside Ulaanbaatar you should always be conscious of animals on the road when driving.  You should plan your journey carefully taking into account your route, weather forecast and fuel stops.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in Mongolia you need an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldrivingpermit.org/\">International Driving Permit</a>. You should also try to familiarise yourself with local laws.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"communications\">Communications</h2>\n\n<p>Most UK phone networks work in cities, but the network can be weak in rural areas. \nWifi is available in many hotels, restaurants and bars, especially in Ulaanbaatar but less so across the rest of the country. You can buy local SIM cards and mobile phones at a reasonable price.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Evidence suggests that domestic services (including helicopter services) in Mongolia do not always comply with international safety standards. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017 the International Civil Aviation Organisation <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a>, evaluating Mongolia\u2019s safety oversight capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>A list of incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=MT\">Aviation Safety Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Flights can be subject to disruption due to weather conditions and maintenance issues. Bear this in mind when making your travel plans.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are known to be used for smuggling. Search your compartment and secure the cabin door before departure. Do not pack something in your luggage or transport any items for someone else.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There have been occasional instances of civil and political unrest resulting in demonstrations and in some cases violence.

They will need the documented support of the company they will visit in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals need to login to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://evisa.mn/\">immigration website</a> and upload the invitation letter, application etc as per instructions.

Once registered you will be issued with a residence permit. The permit will include your date of birth, passport number, address, photograph and fingerprints. You should carry it with you at all times when you\u2019re in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-crossings\">Border crossings</h3>\n\n<p>There are normally 8 border points open to British passport holders. They are at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar, the road/train crossing to China at Zamin Uud, the road crossing to China at Bulgan in the west, the road crossing to China at Bichigt in the south east, the road crossing to Russia at Tsagaannuur in the far west, the train crossing to Russia at Sukhbaatar and the road crossings to Russia at Altanbulag and Ereen-Tsav. You may not cross into China or Russia at any of the other border points as they are either seasonal or are open only to Mongolians, Chinese or Russians.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to bring a vehicle into Mongolia at any of the border crossings you should inform the tax authorities and border troops in advance.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling by train across the China/Mongolia border expect a delay of a few hours as the railways use different gauges.</p>\n\n<p>You may encounter problems when entering Mongolia by train from Russia, particularly with Russian border or customs officials who scrutinise documentation (in particular customs declarations) very carefully. If you\u2019re crossing overland to or from Russia, pay scrupulous attention when completing all the necessary paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-mongolia-by-car\">Entering Mongolia by car</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia by car you should familiarise yourself with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/2012-03-14-03-21-37/2012-03-14-03-22-33/278-regarding-the-regulations-and-procedures-to-cross-motor-vehicles-through-the-mongolian-border\">Mongolian Customs law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Mongolia in a private vehicle you should complete the customs declaration form and make sure you have all valid vehicle documents, including driving licence, ownership records and insurance. You can complete the customs declaration forms on entry at the border, as well as at the Ulaanbaatar City Customs Office situated next to the train station in Ulaanbaatar.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter Mongolia in a private vehicle you must leave in the same vehicle, or otherwise pay customs tax. The amount of tax depends on the size of the engine and the value of your vehicle. You can find more details on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.mn/en/k2-items/2014-03-25-01-12-56\">Mongolian Customs\u2019 webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle breaks down in Mongolia, you won\u2019t be able to leave it there without paying customs tax. If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed you must either pay for it to be transported out of Mongolia, or sell it on to a local mechanic, but you\u2019ll still need to pay customs tax. You mustn\u2019t under any circumstance leave your vehicle unattended or abandon it.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re leaving your vehicle in Mongolia you must leave it in a secure place, either with a mechanic or at an official Customs warehouse, for which you will need to submit a completed customs declaration form and pay a monthly fee for storage. If you leave your vehicle with a mechanic in Mongolia because it cannot be fixed, you must provide proof (photos and a letter from a mechanic and a police report) of this to the Customs Office. If you choose to sell your vehicle, you\u2019ll need to show proof of sale.</p>\n\n<p>Customs tax is payable in local currency (MNT) only and must be paid directly to the Customs Office. If you wish to leave your vehicle and then return to collect it at a later date you should still pay the tax up front, which can then be reimbursed to you when you return to take your vehicle out of Mongolia. If you aren\u2019t able to return in person, ask a third party to make the initial tax payment, and then collect the refund on your behalf.</p>\n",

Your safety is our main concern, but we can not provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you\u2019re concerned about whether or not it\u2019s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to, together with information from other sources you\u2019ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refunds-and-cancellations\">Refunds and cancellations</h3>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you\u2019ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can not offer a refund to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/\">the Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/\">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you\u2019re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-your-travel-details-with-us\">Registering your travel details with us</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re no longer asking people to register with us before travel.
