Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Recent terrorist attacks in Spain include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in January 2023, one person was killed and others injured in a machete attack at 2 churches in Cadiz</li>\n  <li>in 2017, 14 people were killed and over 100 injured across 2 incidents where vehicles were driven into pedestrians in Barcelona and Cambrils</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Demonstrations, political gatherings or marches can take place with little or no warning, particularly in cities. Follow the advice of police and local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>While most demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of unrest or violence. If you\u2019re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, be aware of what is happening around you and move away if there are signs of disorder.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Most visits to Spain are trouble-free, but be alert to street crime. Thieves use distraction techniques, and often work in teams. Take care of your passports, money and personal belongings, particularly when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire.</p>\n\n<p>Do not carry all your valuables in one place. Keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has adequate security. Lock all doors and windows at night, or when out. If concerned about the security of your accommodation, speak to your travel operator or the property owner.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>\u2018Highway pirates\u2019 target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. They may (forcefully) try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of a vehicle, stop in a public area with lights, such as a service station. Be wary of anyone offering help.</p>\n\n<p>When driving, be wary of approaches by people posing as police officers in plain clothes travelling in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will usually be in uniform. All police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID. Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads Police (\u2018Polic\u00eda\u2019) or Civil Guard (\u2018Guardia Civil\u2019), and may use blue flashing lights. Genuine police officers will only ask you to show them your documents and will not ask for your bag or wallet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attacks-and-sexual-assault\">Attacks and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>In an emergency call 112.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur.

Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars in Spain are often stronger than those in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves posing as police officers may ask to see your wallet, claiming they need to see it for identification. Genuine police officers will ask to see ID, but will not ask for wallets or purses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"timeshare-and-holiday-clubs\">Timeshare and holiday clubs</h3>\n\n<p>Timeshare ownership is well established in Spain. There are respected companies, agents and resorts who operate legally and fairly. However, there are also unscrupulous companies who falsely claim to provide incentives.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z-of-fraud/timeshare-fraud\">Read timeshare fraud advice from Action Fraud</a>, the UK\u2019s national fraud reporting centre.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must provide photo ID if requested by a police officer. This includes the Guardia Civil and national, regional and local police forces. The police have the right to hold you at a police station until they have confirmed your identity.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring direct requests of a police officer can be considered as \u2018disobedience\u2019, which is a criminal offence.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels, tourist accommodation and car rental companies have a legal duty to register passport details of tourists when they check-in or collect a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>When checking-in to your accommodation, wait until hotel staff have registered your passport details, or taken a photocopy of your passport. Do not leave your passport at reception to collect later.</p>\n\n<p>You may need to show ID when buying goods with credit or debit cards. Your driving licence or a photocopy of your passport may be accepted, but they may need you to show your original passport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>You cannot drink alcohol in the street in some areas of Spain. You can be given an on-the-spot fine. There are strict controls on drinking and sexual activity in public places, including on beaches.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-in-the-balearic-islands\">Alcohol laws in the Balearic Islands</h3>\n\n<p>Local laws limit the sale and availability of alcohol in areas of some resorts on the islands of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Mallorca</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Magaluf (Calvi\u00e0)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Playa de Palma</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Ibiza</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>San Antonio (San Antoni de Portmany)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This prohibits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>happy hours</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>open bars (such as all you can drink in 1-hour offers)</li>\n  <li>the sale of alcohol from vending machines</li>\n  <li>self-service alcohol dispensers</li>\n  <li>the organising of pub-crawls and party boat trips</li>\n  <li>\u2018off-licence\u2019 sales between 9:30pm and 8am</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hotels and other establishments are obliged to evict customers who behave dangerously on balconies. Both the customer and the establishment can be fined for such behaviour.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possession of even a small quantity of drugs can lead to arrest and detention. Possession of large quantities will usually result in prosecution and a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-commercial-parties-in-villas-and-private-homes\">Illegal commercial parties in villas and private homes</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of serious accidents involving people attending illegal commercially promoted parties in villas and private homes on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca.</p>\n\n<p>Licensed clubs and bars are required to meet safety and security standards, including emergency exits and capacity limits, and to have trained, licensed security staff. Illegal commercial parties may not meet these standards. Take care of your belongings, make sure you know where emergency exits are and do not take unnecessary risks.</p>\n\n<p>You may receive a fine for attending illegal commercially promoted parties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress\">Dress</h3>\n\n<p>In some parts of Spain it\u2019s against the law to be in the street wearing only a bikini or swimming shorts. Being bare-chested is also illegal in some areas in Spain. You may be fined if you\u2019re caught wearing swimwear on the seafront promenade or adjacent streets.</p>\n\n<p>For security reasons, some public authorities in Spain do not allow the burka or niqab to be worn in their buildings. If you visit town council buildings wearing a burka or niqab, you may be asked to remove it while inside.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"changing-money\">Changing money</h3>\n\n<p>When changing money, always use official money exchange offices or banks because unofficial money changers may give you counterfeit money. Possession or use of counterfeit money is considered a serious crime in Spain and may lead to prosecution.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt\">LGBT+</h3>\n\n<p>Spain is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are active LGBT+ communities and social venues, particularly in big cities. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Spain since 2005. Since 2007, transgender people are able to register under their preferred sex in public documents such as birth certificates, identity cards and passports without undergoing prior gender reassignment surgery. Spain does not recognise a third gender.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"falls-from-height\">Falls from height</h3>\n\n<p>There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from height, including balconies. Many accidents have involved British nationals, and have had a devastating impact on those involved and their loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>Do not take unnecessary risks around balconies or other high places, particularly if you\u2019re under the influence of drink or drugs. If you are staying in a room with a balcony, follow the safety advice and watch out for friends who may be at risk.</p>\n\n<p>In some regions you may be fined or evicted from your hotel if you are found to be behaving irresponsibly around balconies. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place on a balcony or if you were under the influence of drink or drugs when the incident happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"festivals-concerts-and-processions\">Festivals, concerts and processions</h3>\n\n<p>Many large events and public processions are held in Spain each year. Follow the advice of police and local authorities when attending events.</p>\n\n<p>Take care of your valuables if attending a festival or large concert. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/festival-travel-checklist\">See the festival travel checklist</a> for more advice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-and-beaches\">Swimming and beaches</h3>\n\n<p>Every year, people drown in the sea and in swimming pools in Spain. Children should always be supervised, even if they can swim or there is a lifeguard present.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming in the sea. Some beaches, especially around Spanish islands, may have strong undercurrents.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid swimming at beaches that are close to rivers. Do not dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death.</p>\n\n<p>Many beaches have a flag system. Make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you must not enter the water). Take extra care and seek local knowledge if there are no lifeguards, flags or signs.</p>\n\n<p>If you are walking along unmanned beaches, be aware that waves can come in further than expected and have strong undertows.</p>\n\n<p>Further tips can be found on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abta.com/tips-and-advice/staying-safe-on-holiday/swim-safe\">ABTA\u2019s swim safe pages</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">Royal Life Saving Society\u2019s \u2018Water Safety on Holiday\u2019</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hill-walking-skiing-and-mountain-activities\">Hill walking, skiing and mountain activities</h3>\n\n<p>Temperatures in some parts of Spain can change very quickly.

Licensing regulations differ across Spain and in certain cities pre-booking is required.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers caught using unlicensed taxi services are liable for fines of up to 600 Euros. Make sure you book your taxi or airport transfer through a licensed firm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Spain, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/spain/\">read the RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021 there were 1,508 road deaths in Spain (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/reported-road-accidents-vehicles-and-casualties-tables-for-great-britain\">source: Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 32 road deaths per million population and compares to the UK average of 24 road deaths per million population in 2021.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>To drive a car or a motorcycle over 125cc in Spain you must be 18 years of age or above, and at least 16 years old to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc.

Provisional licences are not valid for driving in Spain.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re living in Spain, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-spain#driving-in-spain\">check the Living in Guide</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using UK insurance, always carry your certificate with you in case you are stopped. Check that your UK insurance will cover you to drive in Spain, and for how long. This certificate is generally only valid for a stay of less than 3 months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-a-british-car-abroad\">Driving a British car abroad</h3>\n\n<p>You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. In 2021 UK stickers replaced GB stickers. Check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers\">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>Motorists drive on the right-hand side of the road in Spain. Driving rules and customs are different from those in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry 2 red warning triangles which, in the event of an accident or breakdown should be placed in front of and behind the vehicle. They should be at least 50 metres away from the vehicle in each direction. You must have a spare wheel and the tools to change it.

Children under the age of 12 or under 1.35m in height must use an approved child safety seat and be positioned in the back seat. Children are only permitted to travel in the front seat of the car if the rear seats are already occupied by other children or if the vehicle does not have rear seats.

Not wearing one is considered a serious offence and can result in a fine.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to use a mobile phone when driving, even if you have pulled over to the side of the road. You must be completely away from the road. Using an earpiece is also illegal. Only completely hands-free units are allowed to be used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"low-emission-zones\">Low emission zones</h3>\n\n<p>Some inner city areas in Spain have introduced permanent low emission zones (\u2018Zonas de bajas emisiones\u2019 \u2013 ZBE) where only vehicles that meet specific exhaust emission standards and display an air pollution sticker can enter. While air pollution stickers cannot be issued to vehicles with foreign registration plates, some cities do require you to register your vehicle in advance of travel if you wish to enter a low emission zone (e.g. Barcelona). You should check with local authorities in advance of travel for information on local regulations and the requirements for vehicles registered outside of Spain.</p>\n\n<p>The Spanish government\u2019s general information helpline 060 (if calling in Spain) or +34 902 887 060 (if calling from UK) may be able to provide further information.</p>\n\n<p>Some cities also operate emergency anti-pollution protocols to limit exhaust emissions when air pollution levels are high.
