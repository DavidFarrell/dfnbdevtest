Don\u2019t carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you. If you plan to tour the Casbah area of Algiers, use a good local guide and make sure local police and your hosts/hotel know about your plans. Don\u2019t accept lifts from people you don\u2019t know - use a taxi service recommended by the hotel.</p>\n\n<p>Wildfires caused significant damage and numerous deaths in wilayas east of Algiers in summer 2022 and 2021 throughout August 2021. Similar fires could flare up in the same or other areas without warning, especially during periods of extreme weather. You should follow local advice and avoid travelling to areas where fires may break out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-arrangements\">Security arrangements</h3>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. In cities there\u2019s a clear security presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling independently, inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. Your hotel should be able to help you with contacting local authorities. This doesn\u2019t apply if you have dual Algerian nationality. You should accept any security escort you\u2019re offered and co-operate with authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Although you may drive in Algeria with a valid UK driving licence for a maximum of 3 months, the Algerian authorities may also request an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a>. You\u2019re strongly advised to apply for a valid IDP for your temporary stay in Algeria. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. For more information on local regulations, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.interieur.gov.dz/index.php/fr/mes-d%C3%A9marches-administratives/permis-de-conduire\">Algerian Interior Ministry</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>While the major road system has improved, take particular care on minor roads and at night. Algeria has a very high road traffic accident rate. If possible travel in a convoy of at least 2-3 vehicles outside the main towns.</p>\n\n<p>If you are taking a taxi, ask your hotel to phone a reputable firm and don\u2019t allow other unknown passengers to join you during the journey. Arrange with the driver to collect you for the return journey as taxis are not widely available, particularly after dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h2>\n\n<p>Algerian family law is different from UK law. If you\u2019re a dual British-Algerian national, take particular care if <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/permission-take-child-abroad\">child custody</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/stop-forced-marriage\">forced marriage</a> is likely to become an issue during your stay. Children (under the age of 19 years and one day) leaving Algeria need written authorisation from their parent with legal guardianship to travel if they\u2019re travelling alone or accompanied by an adult. If you have any concerns, seek advice before travelling to Algeria or agreeing to family members travelling to Algeria.</p>\n",

There is also a risk that lone actors target foreigners. You should remain vigilant at all times and follow specific advice and direction of the local security authorities.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

The largest presence is in the southern desert region and in areas bordering Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali and Mauritania. Terrorists also operate in small numbers in mountainous areas in the north. However, there remains a high risk of terrorist attacks throughout the country including in Algiers and other major cities, and against UK and Western interests.  It is possible that terrorist groups will exploit targets of opportunity for attack or kidnap.</p>\n\n<p>The main terrorist threat is from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and other regional Islamist groups including Al Murabitun and Daesh-affiliates. There\u2019s also a threat from individuals inspired by Daesh. These groups have been active across the country and pose a threat throughout Algeria, including in Algiers and other major cities.</p>\n\n<p>The threat from terrorism is higher in some parts of the country:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the southern border (where the kidnap risk is concentrated)</li>\n  <li>the Libyan and Tunisian borders;</li>\n  <li>rural, and in particular mountainous, areas in the north and between Tunisia and Algiers;</li>\n  <li>the Sahara.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Algerian authorities continue to conduct effective counter terrorism operations to disrupt terrorist activity but there\u2019s a continuing threat of further terrorist attacks. You should be vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>There have been attacks against Algerian government interests and security forces, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>On 14 October 2021, a soldier was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device whilst conducting a routine patrol in the province of Tlemcen</li>\n  <li>on 6 August 2021, two soldiers were killed by an Improvised Explosive Device whilst conducting a search and sweep operation in the province of Ain Defla</li>\n  <li>on 2 January 2021, two soldiers were killed whilst conducting a search and sweep operation in the province of Tipasa</li>\n  <li>on 20 June 2020, an ambush in Ain Defla, North West Algeria, led to the death of an Algerian army corporal. AQIM is reported to have claimed responsibility</li>\n  <li>on 9 February 2020, one Algerian soldier was killed in a suicide attack on a military outpost in Timeaouine, close to the Malian border. Daesh is reported to have claimed responsibility</li>\n  <li>on 18 November 2019, during an operation by the Algerian army in the southern Tamanrasset region, two alleged IS members were killed. Daesh have reported this same incident as an attack killing eight Algerian security forces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been attacks and threats made against foreign and economic interests, including oil and gas facilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>on 18 March 2016, AQI-M attacked the In Salah Gas Joint Venture in central Algeria with explosive munitions fired from a distance. There were no injuries or casualties</li>\n  <li>on 16 January 2013 Al Murabitun attacked a gas plant near In Amenas killing 40 foreign workers, including 6 British nationals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indiscriminate attacks are not common but on 8 October 2021, 3 civilians were seriously injured by IED explosions in Tebessa and Batna and on 16 January 2021, a roadside bomb killed 5 Algerian citizens in Telidjane, Tebessa province, on the border with Tunisia. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for placement of the landmines, but denied that they were targeting civilians.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a kidnap threat to visitors in Algeria, particularly in the southern and eastern border areas (bordering Mali and Libya respectively). Terrorist kidnappers have previously targeted foreigners, government officials and civilians in Algeria and the Sahel region. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-threat-from-terrorism-in-the-sahel-region\">Sahel page</a> for information on the Sahel regional threat.</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya, Mauritania and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-IM) and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region\u2019s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n",
