Border guards will use passport stamps to check you\u2019re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<p>You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport.

Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons) you must meet the Dutch government\u2019s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you may need on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/immigration-to-the-netherlands/question-and-answer/which-visa-do-i-need-to-travel-to-the-netherlands\">Dutch government website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-the-netherlands-for-work\">travelling to the Netherlands for work</a>, read the guidance on visas and permits.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay in the Netherlands with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/160/netherlands\">check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of the Netherlands.

Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>in 2019, 4 people were killed and 6 injured in a shooting incident in Utrecht</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>in 2018, 2 people were seriously injured in a knife attack at Amsterdam Central Station</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protect-your-belongings\">Protect your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pick-pocketing and bag snatching are common, particularly in central Amsterdam and around Amsterdam Central Station. Thieves often operate in gangs on the trains and trams to and from Schiphol airport and Central Station. One thief distracts you while another steals your bag. Sleeping on trains can make you an easy target.</p>\n\n<p>Thieves can enter restaurants attempting to sell you something or look for someone. Bags have been stolen from between people\u2019s feet while they were distracted.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be alert</li>\n  <li>keep sight of your luggage and belongings</li>\n  <li>keep valuables safely on you</li>\n  <li>not leave bags or jackets hanging on the back of a chair in restaurants</li>\n  <li>avoid falling asleep in public or on public transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams--fake-police-id\">Scams \u2013 fake police ID</h3>\n\n<p>Amsterdam police have warned of criminals\u202fusing false police identities to trick tourists into handing over cash and credit cards. They will usually say that it is part of and investigation into counterfeit money and false credit cards. Be very cautious about any approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Genuine plain-clothed police will rarely carry out this type of inspection. Dutch police don\u2019t have shiny badges, which the fake police sometimes present as ID.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be cautious if approached</li>\n  <li>ask for identity and check it thoroughly</li>\n  <li>not let them intimidate you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Call 0900-8844 to contact the nearest police station if you are unsure whether a police person is genuine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drug-sellers\">Drug sellers</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid confrontation with anyone offering you drugs. Stay away from quiet or dark alleys, particularly late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of drink spiking, particularly for young women and solo travellers. Don\u2019t leave your drink unattended. \u202fIf you think your drink has been spiked, seek immediate medical help and inform the police. If you are in\u202fa group, make sure you leave together.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>By law, anyone from the age of 14 and over must always be able to show a valid form of identification. British nationals should use their passport as ID. Dual-nationals can show a valid Dutch driving license, passport or Dutch/European identity card. For people aged 16 or over who fail to comply with the requirement to identify themselves, the fine is 100 euros. For persons aged 14 and 15, the fine is 50 euros.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t carry or use drugs. The Netherlands has a reputation for being tolerant on the use of \u2018soft drugs\u2019, such as cannabis. However, drugs are illegal and drug use is only tolerated in designated premises in the major cities. Buying or possessing prohibited drugs and substances outside of designated areas, is illegal and can result in a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Buying or smoking soft drugs in public places is an offence. There are specific caf\u00e9s where the use of cannabis is tolerated.</p>\n\n<p>The sale of dry and fresh psychoactive mushrooms is illegal. However, the truffle (sclerotium) form of psychoactive (psilocybin) mushrooms are not covered under Dutch law (Opium Act) and are still sold in regulated \u2018smart shops\u2019.

If you are fined, always ask for a receipt.</p>\n\n<p>Watch out for trams. They have priority over other traffic. You must stop if a tram or a bus stops in the middle of the road to let passengers on and off.</p>\n\n<p>Speed cameras, speed traps and unmarked vehicles are widely used. Motorway speed limits can vary. You must follow overhead illuminated lane indicators when in use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pedestrians-and-road-safety\">Pedestrians and road safety</h3>\n\n<p>Be careful when crossing roads, especially on zebra crossings. Look out for cyclists and mopeds, who have right of way over motor vehicles and often ignore road traffic rules and red lights.</p>\n\n<p>You could be fined for jaywalking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"amsterdam-canals\">Amsterdam canals</h2>\n\n<p>Every year people drown in the canals of Amsterdam.
