You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public protests occur from time to time and can cause traffic disruption. Protests are normally peaceful. Keep up to date with developments through the media, be vigilant and avoid all protests.</p>\n\n<p>There is a small risk of violent incidents linked to locally controversial issues, usually from the conflict of the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in anti-UK rhetoric from some politicians in the Republika Srpska (one of the entities that makes up the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina). This could translate into wider anti-UK sentiment. You should avoid political demonstrations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>You can report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a written report. Local police do not always have English language skills and you may need the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bosnia-and-herzegovina-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/bosnia-and-herzegovina-translators-and-interpreters\">services of a translator</a> .</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of pickpockets on public transport and in the tourist and pedestrian areas of Sarajevo and other cities. Make sure personal belongings, including your passport, are secure. Obvious displays of wealth, including large quantities of cash or jewellery and luxury vehicles can make you a target for opportunist thieves.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in thefts from cars in popular tourist areas in and around Sarajevo, particularly on Mount Trebevic. Make sure your vehicle is locked and your belongings are out of sight. Take particular care in areas popular with foreign tourists and in crowded public venues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"old-landmines-and-unexploded-weapons\">Old landmines and unexploded weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons remain from the 1992 to 1995 war. Whilst highly populated areas and major routes are largely clear, risks remain in less populated and rural areas.  Do not stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide.  Take care near:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the former lines of conflict</li>\n  <li>the edge of roads</li>\n  <li>the open countryside</li>\n  <li>destroyed or abandoned buildings (including in towns)</li>\n  <li>neglected land</li>\n  <li>untarred roads</li>\n  <li>woods and orchards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For further information, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhmac.org/?lang=en\">Mine Action Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"english-language\">English language</h3>\n\n<p>English is not always widely spoken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport or official photo ID with you at all times. You must be able to show some form of identification if required, including when checking into hotels. For more information, see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://msb.gov.ba/inf_za_strance/default.aspx?id=3068&amp;langTag=en-US\">Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The dates vary by year and country.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from other guests</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes \u2013 clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There are no laws against same-sex relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but LGBT+ communities continue to report incidents of discrimination and even violence. Showing affection in public is likely to be frowned upon and may receive unwelcome attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Check that your travel and medical insurance cover you for any adventure activities and sports.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diving\">Diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving off Mostar bridge is dangerous and has resulted in serious injuries and fatalities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rafting\">Rafting</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/bosnia-herzegovina/\">RAC guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling outside the main towns and cities, especially in winter when road conditions can worsen quickly.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in an accident, stay at the scene and do not move your vehicle until the police arrive. Traffic police can impose on-the-spot fines for any traffic offence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>For visits of up to 6 months, you need\u00a0either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> or a valid UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, you will need to get a local driving licence. Bosnian authorities will keep your UK licence (or any other foreign licence)  when applying for a Bosnian one. You cannot exchange an international driving permit for a Bosnian licence.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bhembassy.co.uk/pocetna-eng/\">Contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in London</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to the country. The British Embassy will not be able to help if you do not have the correct documentation when you arrive at the border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-insurance\">Border insurance</h3>\n\n<p>Border insurance is required for all vehicles crossing into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not always possible to buy border insurance at all border crossings. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://granpol.gov.ba/\">Border Police</a> advise travellers to use the recently upgraded   crossings at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bijaca</li>\n  <li>Crveni Grm (south)</li>\n  <li>Izacici (west)</li>\n  <li>Kamensko</li>\n  <li>Karakaj and Raca (east)</li>\n  <li>Samac (north-east)</li>\n  <li>Zubci (south-east)</li>\n  <li>Doljani</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"winter-equipment-requirements\">Winter equipment requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Between November and April you are legally required to use winter equipment on your vehicle. This means:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>all tyres must have an MS, M+S or M&amp;S mark and a stylised symbol of a snowflake \u2013 the tread should be at least 4 millimetres deep</li>\n  <li>snow chains should be carried as their use is compulsory in winter conditions\u00a0if the sign is displayed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Official taxis in Sarajevo and the major towns are well-regulated and metered. Taxi drivers from the Republika Srpska might refuse to drive to a destination in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the same from the Federation to the Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p>Do not use unlicensed taxis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Sarajevo (Butmir) International airport is prone to fog, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled during the winter months, particularly in December and January. Many airlines will not take responsibility for accommodation due to delays caused by adverse weather. If you are travelling into or out of Sarajevo during winter, make sure you have enough money if you are forced to extend your stay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>Forest fires are common in Herzegovina (the southern part of the country) during summer heat waves, mostly happening in inaccessible areas. Fires are normally kept under control, but if they get close to populated areas, road closures are possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Flash floods and landslides remain a risk in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina after heavy rain. Follow the instructions and guidance provided by local officials and traffic police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes and small tremors are recorded throughout the year, usually without consequences.
