These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you\u2019re transiting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) have recently cancelled multiple flights to and from Gilgit and Skardu Airports in the north of Pakistan. Flight schedules may be unreliable and may change at short notice. You should consult your airline and/or travel agent.</p>\n\n<p>Road routes are also likely to be restricted by seasonal weather, with the Babusar Pass liable to close due to snowfall.</p>\n\n<p>Options to leave the north of Pakistan may therefore become limited.</p>\n\n<p>It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> <a href=\"/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before the COVID pandemic there were nearly half a million visits by British nationals to Pakistan. Most visits are trouble free.</p>\n\n<p>In late August 2023, there were large demonstrations and protests in Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan. There remains a risk of protests, which could turn violent, and road closures throughout the region. Gatherings of four or more people are banned and the mobile phone and data network is disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>Political rallies and protests regularly take place across Pakistan. Some may have an anti-western dimension and could turn violent. Tear gas can be used to disperse protests. Avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and political events. Be alert to local news and, where possible, social media and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour company. If you find yourself near protests, turn away and move to a safe place. See\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan. There\u2019s a high threat of terrorism, kidnap and sectarian violence throughout the country, including the major cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi. Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. You should try to avoid all crowds and public events including political gatherings and religious events throughout Pakistan, and <a href=\"/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">take appropriate security precautions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, hiking trails, airports, infrastructure projects, public transport, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Some periods of the year may pose heightened risks. During holy periods/religious holidays, there is an increased potential for targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan can experience extreme weather, including severe heatwaves. These typically occur between March and June. The extreme temperatures can cause poor air quality, wildfires and power cuts.  You should avoid unnecessary exposure to direct sunlight and take precautionary measures.  More information and detailed guidance is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cms.ndma.gov.pk/\">National Disaster Management Authority website</a>.  You should monitor the local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.pmd.gov.pk/en/\">Pakistan Meteorological Department</a>, follow the advice of local authorities and your tour company before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>The monsoon season in Pakistan is from late June to early October. Heavy rains can cause severe flash flooding in both urban and rural areas. Travel in many parts of the country can be severely impacted. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Pakistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from further earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Call 15 to contact the police. Call 1122 for the fire service or an ambulance. Services may vary and will be more limited outside major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Pakistan where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British High Commission\u2019s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we\u2019ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice\">Read more about how the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>\n\n<p>If you are abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/overseas-business-risk\">Overseas Business Risk service</a> offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.</p>\n\n",

Take particular care of your passport, bank cards, bags, jewellery, laptop and mobile, especially on public transport, when travelling to and from the airport and in crowded areas including markets. There is an active black market in forged and stolen passports. Credit card fraud is common.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise caution when moving around urban areas at night, especially if travelling on foot.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals of Pakistani origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals.</p>\n\n<p>Much of Balochistan, northern Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have a high level of lawlessness.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations are common in Pakistan.  You should keep track of the local news. Protests can occur with little warning and while most remain peaceful, they can turn violent and escalate quickly. During elections, political events, rallies and polling stations have been the target of terrorist attacks. You should avoid all political demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events and be prepared to change your plans as necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>The Pakistan authorities currently advise that \u201call foreigners, including diplomats may not move out of their city of residence without proper security and without prior co-ordination with the law enforcement agency\u201d. This requirement has not been rigorously enforced, but you should consider informing local authorities of any travel plans, and be prepared to be stopped and challenged by officials, who may instruct you to turn around.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling in Pakistan, you or your travel company should contact the local authorities of your destination in advance to check the local security situation. They may arrange police protection as necessary and will advise whether you need a No Objection Certificate issued by the Pakistani Ministry of Interior.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise care in selecting accommodation and take precautions to maintain safety and keep a low profile.</p>\n\n<p>Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan. More information about altitude sickness is available from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness\">TravelHealthPro</a> (from the UK\u2019s National Travel Health Network and Centre).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas</h3>\n\n<p>Except for official border crossing points, foreigners are not allowed to travel within certain distances of Pakistan\u2019s international borders. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel to within 5 miles of Pakistan\u2019s border with India and within 10 miles of the Line of Control</li>\n  <li>10 miles of the border with China</li>\n  <li>10 miles of the border with Afghanistan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you travel to these areas you may be arrested and detained.</p>\n\n<p>The situation for border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan may change rapidly due to the security situation in Afghanistan. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Afghanistan or within 10 miles of the Afghan border as well as Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan Province and a number of districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">summary</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"islamabad\">Islamabad</h3>\n<p>Police and security agencies have a significant presence in Islamabad. You should exercise caution in the outlying districts, such as I8, I9, I10 and areas further west, where security forces have conducted operations against suspected criminals and terrorists.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid all protests. Crowded areas such as the Red Mosque (Lal Masjid) and Aabpara Market in G6 have been a focal point for protests in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karachi\">Karachi</h3>\n\n<p>Karachi can be prone to varying levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. Criminal and political violence is common including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by various religious and political parties are capable of causing significant disruption across the city and can occasionally lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller scale labour strikes are also a common occurrence and cause regular disruptions on a more localised scale.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of terrorism throughout the country. On 17 February 2023 militants attacked a police station in the city killing a number of police officers. On 26 April 2022, a suicide bomb at the University of Karachi targeted Chinese nationals and killed 4 people. Public service and health officials have also been subject to attacks in the past whilst delivering health programmes. There is also a risk of violence in parts of the city which include government offices. Major hotels and the financial district are generally regarded as more stable, though there remains a risk of violence, particularly following Friday prayers.</p>\n\n<p>You should carefully plan any travel within the city. You should take advice from hosts or trusted contacts, abide by direction from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans. Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town have a greater risk of violence based on past activity. Exercise heightened vigilance if visiting these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lahore\">Lahore</h3>\n\n<p>Lahore is the capital of Punjab province, and attracts large numbers of tourists and business travellers.  While the city has a widespread police presence, there have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent years. These have targeted public places and government or security forces. You should avoid religious events or gatherings, public events and large crowds of people throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"balochistan\">Balochistan</h3>\n\n<p>There is a significant risk from kidnapping and militant activity in much of Balochistan. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to most of the province (see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">Summary</a>) other than the southern coast of Balochistan where we advise against all but essential travel. The southern coast is defined as the area south of (and including) the N10 motorway as well as the section of the N25 which runs from the N10/N25 intersection to the Balochistan/Sindh border, including the port city of Gwadar.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to visit the southern coast of Balochistan, make sure you have the necessary permission from the authorities and proper security arrangements in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gilgit-baltistan\">Gilgit-Baltistan</h3>\n\n<p>In late August 2023, there were large-scale religious protests in Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan. There remains a risk of protests, which could turn violent, and road closures throughout the region. Gatherings of four or more people are banned and the mobile phone and data network is disrupted. You should take care to avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and political events.</p>\n\n<p>The terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan is mountainous, with remote and isolated locations that are difficult to police effectively. You are strongly advised to obtain and follow local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements in advance of any visit.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You may need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, in particular for mountains over 6,000 metres. The permission process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you do not have the correct permits.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups. Do not trek alone. Be aware of the risks of altitude sickness.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karakoram-highway\">Karakoram Highway</h3>\n\n<p>The Karakoram Highway runs from Hasan Abdal in north Punjab towards Gilgit and the Chinese border. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel on the Highway between Mansehra and Chilas via Battagram, Besham City, Dasu and Sazin up to the junction with the N15. You should avoid travelling on the Highway at night - the road can be narrow with sudden steep drops. All sections of the Highway north of Batagram up to the Chinese border have experienced landslides.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"khyber-pakhtunkhwa\">Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa</h3>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all travel to much of the province (see\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan\">Summary</a>). There is military or militant activity in a number of districts. Militant violence is frequent in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  Localised curfews may be imposed at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>Arandu District to the south and west of Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is sometimes subject to cross border attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pakistan-administered-kashmir\">Pakistan-administered Kashmir</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel 10 miles of the Line of Control.</p>\n\n<p>Following a terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February 2019, there remain heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly across the Line of Control.</p>\n\n<p>There is regular military activity on the Line of Control. Although a ceasefire has been implemented, there remain significant tensions between India and Pakistan and there is a serious risk of small arms fire (roughly up to 300 metres from the Line) and occasional mortar fire (roughly up to 7 kilometres from the Line).</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to travel. Specific requirements can change and you should check the latest requirements before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"punjab\">Punjab</h3>\n\n<p>If you travel to southern Punjab take advice about the local security situation in advance. There are frequent reports of criminality and public order incidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sindh\">Sindh</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to areas of Sindh Province north of, and including, the city of Nawabshah.\nThere are high levels of lawlessness in the north of Sindh Province with  a very high risk from crime and kidnapping. The area is frequented by criminal gangs or bandits with access to heavy weaponry. On 6 November 2022 a large criminal gang attacked police in Ghotki, northern Sindh, killing several officers and taking others hostage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Pakistan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers travelling on domestic air routes are no longer required to present evidence of COVID-19 vaccination.</p>\n\n<p>Due to recent cases of Mpox (formerly known as Monkey Pox) there may be enhanced screening and preventive measures at points of entry.</p>\n\n<p>There is limited public transport from the Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), but taxi services are available. It is recommended that you only use taxis from reputable, licenced companies that are radio-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>Allow yourself enough time to get through enhanced airport security checks, but do not linger unnecessarily. Be vigilant, follow instructions from security and airport personnel, and contact your airline in the event of any disruption.</p>\n\n<p>Flights into the mountainous areas in the north of Pakistan are frequently delayed or cancelled due to extreme weather.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid using the railway network, which has been subject to terrorist attacks as well as derailments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>You should have a <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> to drive in Pakistan. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted. You can only get IDPs over the counter from selected UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. If you are planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan has a modern and efficient motorway system between the major cities. The quality of other roads is more variable. Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Road conditions can be poor and there is a risk of carjacking.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using street taxis. Only use taxis from reputable, licensed companies which are radio-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>For your safety, you should avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus which operates between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>\n\n<p>The north of Pakistan is mountainous, with some of the highest peaks in the world contained within this area. As a result many roads are inaccessible at certain times of the year due to extreme weather conditions, and landslides frequently block or destroy roads. The N15 Highway between Chilas and Babusar in Gilgit Baltistan is closed at certain times of the year due to weather and is susceptible to landslides.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended that you only use experienced local drivers when traversing these routes and should only attempt to do so in clear weather conditions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h2>\n\n<p>The threat from piracy within 12 nautical miles of the Pakistani coastline is low, but you should be aware of the significant threat piracy poses in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.</p>\n\n",

The main terrorist threat comes from Tehrik-e Taleban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organisation of groups primarily active in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Daesh is also active. While both groups\u2019 activities are primarily directed against the Pakistani state, they have in the past stated an intent to launch attacks on western interests. TTP and Daesh conduct attacks throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Further attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Previous methods of attack have included grenades, shootings, bombings and suicide bombs. Militants can launch complex and deadly attacks. Be vigilant, keep a low profile and vary your routes and timings if you make any regular journeys. You should avoid large organised gatherings which may expose you to higher risk, such as public protests, religious gatherings and processions, and political rallies. Courts and government buildings, security facilities or personnel can also be the target of attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, hiking trails, airports, public transport, infrastructure projects, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. Additionally, take care if you\u2019re planning to attend sporting events or live music venues. Attacks have previously targeted places that could be considered by militants to be un-Islamic, including CD/DVD shops and barber shops. In recent years, the Pakistani authorities have reintroduced major sporting events into the country, including the Pakistan Super League in cricket. Increased security measures are in place at these events. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas, follow the advice of security personnel and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. There may be a higher risk of terrorist incidents during the month of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistani government personnel and institutions, and the security forces, including police, are prime targets for attacks. Avoid key government installations and gatherings of uniformed personnel, and be vigilant in areas around diplomatic premises throughout Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Places of worship, including churches, religious sites, minority religious sects and shrines are often targeted. You should avoid religious events or gatherings and limit movements on Friday afternoons. During holy periods/religious holidays there may be a higher risk of targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, suffer regular terrorist attacks. There are threats of attacks in Karachi and almost daily violence. Areas of Balochistan, including Quetta experience frequent attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep track of the local news. Incidents can occur and the security situation can deteriorate quickly. There may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h2>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping throughout Pakistan. Both terrorists and criminal groups are involved in hostage-taking.</p>\n\n<p>If you are working or travelling in Pakistan, you should be alert to the threat of kidnap targeting Westerners, including British nationals. British nationals of Pakistani origin are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. British and other foreign national kidnap victims have faced extended periods of detention. While some were ultimately released by their captors, others have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business.  If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx\">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>General information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/\">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you\u2019re abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on imported goods medical supplies may become increasingly hard to find in country. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you\u2019re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you\u2019ll need to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>\nof the country or territory you\u2019re travelling to.</p>\n\n<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues\">guidance page</a>.  Further information is also available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a> (NaTHNaC).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"polio-vaccination-programme\">Polio vaccination programme</h2>\n\n<p>Pakistan is rolling out a widespread Polio vaccination programme in an effort to eradicate Polio. You should provide proof of Polio vaccination if asked by a vaccination team. Any exemption due to a medical condition needs to be supported by a medical certificate issued by recognised health authority.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h2>\n\n<p>Local medical facilities are not comparable to those in the UK, especially in remote areas. For psychiatric illness, specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities in Pakistan. Private medical care is available in all major cities, but expensive. The British High Commission Islamabad maintains a list of medical facilities in different cities of Pakistan. You\u2019re strongly advised to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers the duration of your stay in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1122 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you\u2019re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to travel to Pakistan with your medicine, please consult <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/\">NHS advice</a> before travel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-health-risks\">Other health risks</h2>\n<p>You should follow the advice of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/171/pakistan#CIoutBreaks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should take steps to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance\">avoid being bitten by mosquitoes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when purchasing bottled water.
