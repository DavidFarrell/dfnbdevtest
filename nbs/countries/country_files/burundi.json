In response, the government has prohibited the slaughter of cattle, goats and sheep. To date, there are no report of humans contracting the disease in Burundi, though human infection remains a possibility, through mosquito bites or for people in direct contact with infected animals.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors should be aware of confirmed cases in October of Ebola in Beni, North Kivu province in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in the same province as a previous outbreak. North Kivu province borders Uganda and Rwanda. Further information and updates on Ebola can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/ebola-virus-disease\">WHO website</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#current-incidents-and-outbreaks\">Public Health England (PHE) website</a>. These are the first Ebola cases reported since \u2018Outbreak 12\u2019 in North Kivu was declared over on 3 May 2021. No cases have been reported in Burundi.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Burundi as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/38/burundi#Other_risks\">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An outbreak of cholera continues in Burundi.  You should take <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/cholera/\">necessary precautions</a> and seek urgent medical attention if you become unwell.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/38/burundi#Malaria\">Malaria</a> is endemic throughout Burundi.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid swimming in Lake Tanganyika due to the risk of being attacked by wildlife and waterborne diseases.</p>\n\n<p>UNAIDS estimated that in 2019 there were around 76,000 adults aged 15 or over in Burundi were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 1% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medical-treatment\">Medical treatment</h3>\n\n<p>If you become ill during or immediately after travelling to the country, seek medical advice immediately. Kira Hospital, Hopital Militaire de Kamenge or Medecin sans frontieres, which operates from Hospital Prince Regent Charles, are able to provide appropriate medical care for most serious accidents within Bujumbura. Outside Bujumbura, there is a lack of adequate medical facilities and medical evacuation to Kenya or Rwanda may be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, check <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/burundi-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/burundi-list-of-medical-facilities\">Burundi\u2019s list of medical facilities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The list is not exhaustive.</p>\n",
