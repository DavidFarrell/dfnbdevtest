Disarmament and reconstruction measures have begun. The situation in Tigray is still fragile and there may still be isolated armed incidents.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In August 2023, a state of emergency was imposed after conflict started between Amhara militia groups (Fano) and the Ethiopian National Defence Force. Conflict continues in Amhara region.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There have been increased tensions and violence between armed groups and the security forces across Oromia region.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Unrest can occur with no notice. There are ongoing armed clashes between ethnic groups. Foreigners have not been targeted. However you should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media\u00a0</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator\u00a0</li>\n  <li>reconsider travel to affected areas\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. Comply with the law, including in relation to carrying ID cards, and possession of foreign currency and weapons. Avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strikes-and-protests\">Strikes and protests</h3>\n\n<p>Because of  frequent civil unrest, including protests and strikes, there is frequently:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks</li>\n  <li>disruption to local businesses and transport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There is a risk of kidnapping in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region and on the southern border with Kenya. This is particularly the case in the eastern areas where <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnapping in western areas of Oromia region, particularly West Wollega, East Wollega and Qellem Wollega zones. Recent kidnaps have targeted the mining industry. British nationals working in the area should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement and aim to only travel during daylight hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Stay vigilant at all times. Make sure you carefully consider the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place. People engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"detention-of-british-nationals\">Detention of British nationals\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia. The risk may increase if tensions are heightened around major events, or in locations that are sensitive for security reasons. Carry photocopies of your passport and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-addis-ababa\">contact details of the British Embassy Addis Ababa</a> in case you are questioned or detained. Your physical passport is not necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopian authorities do not always notify embassies when foreign nationals are detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always provided. If authorities do not inform the embassy, ask family or friends to contact the British Embassy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can be targeted by groups of youths through pickpocketing and scams.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Theft and mugging is on the rise. There has been a smaller number of more serious incidents, including sexual harassment of women. Violent robberies can occur in parks and walking sites in Addis Ababa.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Take care of your belongings when visiting crowded public places, especially at night. Be vigilant if strangers approach you. Criminal gangs use distraction techniques including begging, spitting, spilling food and drink, and feigning illness.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of pickpocketing, bag and jewellery snatching, including from vehicles at traffic lights.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When travelling in vehicles, you should:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep belongings with you\u00a0</li>\n  <li>keep valuables out of sight\u00a0</li>\n  <li>keep vehicle doors locked\u00a0</li>\n  <li>park in well-lit and guarded areas such as hotels, government and tourist locations, which all have security at their entrances\u00a0</li>\n  <li>consider fitting anti-shatter film to all windows (we do not recommend short term visitors modify their hire vehicles)\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If threatened, hand over valuables without resistance.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-and-safety\">Health and safety\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"date-and-time\">Date and time\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Traditionally Ethiopia has a different calendar and way of expressing time than are widely used internationally.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Most hotels and larger organisations\u2019 documents, including airline tickets, use the international calendar and clock. However:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>official documents are often dated using the Ethiopian calendar\u00a0</li>\n  <li>individuals and smaller organisations might use the Ethiopian clock\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Ethiopia is a cash-based society. Banking facilities, including card payments and ATMs are limited, especially outside of cities. It is not normally possible to get a cash advance. Make sure you have enough cash before leaving cities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Drug offences are treated seriously in Ethiopia. Possession of drugs can lead to prison sentences of 5 to 10 years and potentially large fines.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Khat is legal in Ethiopia but it is illegal to take it out of the country. Bags are regularly searched at Addis Ababa Bole Airport. Anyone found with khat is likely to be prosecuted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>There are no restrictions on buying or possessing alcohol. This includes the predominantly Muslim regions although it may be more difficult to obtain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Ethiopia is religiously diverse and largely tolerant. However, many people are devout in their faith. Take care to not offend local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively and observe local customs. Take particular care if travelling:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan\u00a0</li>\n  <li>to religious sites of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church\u00a0</li>\n  <li>outside Addis Ababa, particularly in rural areas\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ramadan is individually observed but there are no official regulations imposed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"women-travellers\">Women travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Women are expected to dress conservatively, especially when visiting religious sites.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal and carry penalties of between 1 and 15 years imprisonment. It is reported that the local authorities are intimidating owners and clients of hotels, bars and restaurants in Addis Ababa where same-sex activity is alleged to take place.</p>\n\n<p>The public are not generally accepting of same-sex relationships. Some religious leaders have called for violence against the LGBT+ community. Be aware of local laws and customs. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"imports-and-exports\">Imports and exports\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>You need an export certificate to take antiques out of the country. Without one your items are likely to be confiscated and you could be prosecuted.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Owning ivory is illegal. British nationals have had ivory jewellery confiscated and been fined up to 25,000 Ethiopian birr.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photos:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>near military zones or of military personnel\u00a0</li>\n  <li>near the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa\u00a0</li>\n  <li>where signs prohibit photography\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"satellite-phones-and-binoculars\">Satellite phones and binoculars\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Satellite phones and binoculars cannot be imported or exported to or from Ethiopia without prior approval from the Customs and Information Network and Security Agency. Get advice from your travel provider on permissions required.</p>\n\n<p>Unapproved items can be confiscated by authorities, with the possibility of being able to collect them on departure from Ethiopia, but this is not guaranteed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The importation and use of drones within Ethiopia is subject to permission by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority and Information Network and Security Agency. Without written clearance drones can be subject to confiscation at airports or borders.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rural-areas\">Rural areas\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>When travelling outside Addis Ababa, avoid driving after dark. Vehicles often have no lights and livestock may roam on roads.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While mobile telephone services are increasingly widespread, connectivity cannot be guaranteed. Mobile internet can be closed down with no notice.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You might want to consider travelling in a group and leaving details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cars-and-motorbikes-\">Cars and motorbikes \u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and traffic accidents happen regularly, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. If you\u2019re involved in a traffic accident, stay in your vehicle and call the local police. Avoid confrontation and wait for police to arrive to deal with any issues.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Localised demonstrations have led to temporary road closures or the targeting of public transport. However, not all social media reports of such disruptions are accurate. If unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you\u2019re travelling to.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you meet a roadblock, follow advice of local authorities if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and do not attempt to pass it.\u00a0</p>\n\n",
