If you\u2019re staying in a hotel, check-in staff will register you automatically. If you do not register, you could get a fine, and face arrest and a court appearance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>British nationals do not need a visa to visit Serbia for up to 90 days. For further information on entry and exit requirements, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.london.mfa.gov.rs/\">Serbian embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to extend your stay in Serbia, you must apply for temporary residence status. You must do this at the police station where you\u2019re registered at least 30 days before the 90-day period expires. For more information visit the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/\">Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"checks-at-border-control\">Checks at border control</h3>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>When entering Serbia, make sure border guards stamp your passport. Temporary residents should have an exit-entry visa as well as a residence stamp. If you try to leave Serbia without an entry stamp or exit-entry visa, you may face charges of illegal immigration, a heavy fine and a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>You should only enter Serbia through recognised border crossings. Serbian borders remain open for entry and exit, subject to any entry requirements currently in place in neighbouring countries.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-between-serbia-and-kosovo\">Travelling between Serbia and Kosovo</h2>\n\n<p>The authorities in Serbia do not consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official international border crossing points.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to travel from Serbia to Kosovo, and back again.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot travel from Kosovo to Serbia without a Serbian entry stamp from Belgrade, Ni\u0161 or Kraljevo airports, or one of Serbia\u2019s other border crossings with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bosnia and Herzegovina</li>\n  <li>Bulgaria</li>\n  <li>Croatia</li>\n  <li>Hungary</li>\n  <li>Montenegro</li>\n  <li>North Macedonia</li>\n  <li>Romania</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are likely to be refused entry without a valid Serbian entry stamp. You should take a route through a third country.</p>\n\n<p>Border guards have denied foreign nationals entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports. We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo can cause difficulties at border crossings with Kosovo.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccination-requirements-other-than-covid-19\">Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/193/serbia\">check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro\u2019s Serbia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.carina.rs/en/passengers/passenger-customs-clearance/useful-information-for-passengers.html\">goods that can be brought into and taken out of Serbia</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>You must declare items of value if you are temporarily bringing them to Serbia to avoid customs charges \u2013 for example, jewellery, cameras and computing equipment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-money-into-serbia\">Taking money into Serbia</h2>\n\n<p>If you are carrying more than 10,000 euros (or an equal amount in other currencies), you must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>complete a declaration form at customs on arrival in Serbia \u2013 a customs officer will certify this by signing or stamping the form</li>\n  <li>keep a copy of the certified form while you are in Serbia</li>\n  <li>show the certified form when you leave Serbia</li>\n  <li>show a receipt if you are carrying Serbian dinars bought from a foreign bank</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Customs officers may seize your money if you do not follow these rules.</p>\n\n<p>You should exchange any unwanted dinars before you leave Serbia. British banks do not normally exchange dinars. Do not use street dealers. Only change money through banks or official exchange offices.</p>\n\n<p>It is not possible to exchange Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes in Serbia.</p>\n\n",

You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. Remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is the potential for disturbances in Belgrade and other towns and cities. There have been mass gatherings in Belgrade and other cities since May 2023. Further gatherings are planned. These can cause significant disruption, including to public transport. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep up to date with local developments</li>\n  <li>plan ahead to avoid disruption</li>\n  <li>avoid crowds or demonstrations to avoid injury</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities. Pickpockets work in tourist areas, airports, on public transport and at motorway petrol stations.</p>\n\n<p>As a foreigner, criminals may assume you are carrying large amounts of cash. Four-wheel drive and luxury vehicles are also popular targets.</p>\n\n<p>Some sporting events have had incidents of violence and petty crime.\nReport all incidents of crime to the local police and get a report.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexploded-landmines-and-bombs\">Unexploded landmines and bombs</h2>\n\n<p>There is still some danger from unexploded landmines and bombs from the 1999 war in Kosovo and Serbia. Most of the affected areas are in the mountains to the north and east of Kosovo. Take special care in these areas and keep to marked roads.</p>\n\n<p>Thick vegetation covers most of the dangerous areas. Do not touch anything suspicious and report it to the police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to carry your passport (as a tourist) or ID card (as a resident) with you for identification purposes.  Keep a copy separately in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are strict penalties for possessing and trafficking drugs, including long prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles anywhere in Serbia may lead to arrest or difficulties with the authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in Serbia, and there are anti-discrimination laws. There are LGBT+ friendly hostels, clubs and other events in Belgrade. However, the level of public prejudice against LGBT+ people is still relatively high. Be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Serbia. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a> that offers this service.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive with a UK driving licence or <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> for a series of short visits up to a year after you first entered Serbia, or for a single stay of up to 6 months. If you\u2019re staying longer than 6 months, you must get a local licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Serbia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/serbia/\">RAC Serbia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The general standard of roads in Serbia varies widely. Roads are worse in rural areas, especially after bad weather. One particularly dangerous road is the Ibarska Magistrala (linking Belgrade, via \u010ca\u010dak and U\u017eice, to Montenegro).</p>\n\n<p>Dial 1987 for roadside assistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>You should only use registered taxis \u2013 look for a municipal registration number alongside the cab number. Instead of hailing a taxi, you can call one of the radio taxi phone numbers (most operators speak English). See information about taxis and public transport from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tob.rs/en/info/useful-info/taxi\">Belgrade tourism organisation</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire</h3>\n\n<p>Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow you to drive their vehicles to Kosovo, Albania or Bulgaria because of security concerns. There have been some incidents where Serbian registered cars have been vandalised, or in some cases set on fire, in more isolated areas of Kosovo.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-a-vehicle-into-serbia\">Bringing a vehicle into Serbia</h3>\n\n<p>If you are bringing a vehicle to Serbia, you must have vehicle registration and ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy. European green card vehicle insurance is now valid in Serbia, but you no longer need to hold a green card. Confirm with your insurance company that your policy covers Serbia.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.london.mfa.gov.rs/\">Serbian embassy in London</a> if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to Serbia. The British embassy cannot help you if you arrive at the border without the correct documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Trains can be slow, particularly in winter when there are often long delays. On overnight trains, sleeping berths can be locked from the inside for safety. Each carriage has an attendant. Local police carry out random ID checks onboard trains in Serbia. Thieves operate on trains, so take particular care that documents and other valuables are safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires.  Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette are properly extinguished and do not light barbecues.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Parts of Serbia can flood after heavy rain. See flood warnings from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hidmet.gov.rs/index_eng.php\">Serbian Hydrometeorological Service</a>. If floods affect your area, follow the instructions of the Serbian authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Serbia lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but can occur. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">US Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> has advice on what to before, during and after an earthquake.</p>\n\n",
