There is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles.

There is a risk that bystanders could be caught up in any of these types of incident.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been large political demonstrations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which have the potential to escalate and become violent. Entry/exit to Ben Gurion Airport has occasionally been impacted during political demonstrations. Check the local news to see if there have been recent clashes, be vigilant, avoid any large gatherings or demonstrations, avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence and follow the instructions of the local authorities. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, you should stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents have occurred in Tel Aviv, Be\u2019er Sheva, Hadera, Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly at and around Damascus Gate, Herod\u2019s gate, Lion\u2019s Gate and the Chain Gate), Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, the Jordan Valley, at Israeli checkpoints, near settlement outposts, and around Palestinian refugee camps. Hebron and Palestinian refugee camps have previously been the site of violent clashes, settlements and settlement outposts have been the site of recent violent incidents (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have also occurred along Route 60 (especially junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth), during Ramadan, in particular Laylat Al Qadr (dates vary), Thursday evenings, after Friday prayers, Saturday evenings and on other religious holidays and anniversaries. This is heightened when different religious or national holidays overlap. Independence Day (14 May, Hebrew calendar dates vary), Jerusalem Day (date varies), Land Day (30 March) and Nakba Day (15 May) may be tense. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. You should exercise extreme caution: follow local media and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>\u00a0and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.

Some of these protests have led to violent clashes. Stay alert at all times in the Old City and leave the area if there is evidence of tension or unrest (for example if the shops in the souks suddenly begin to close their shutters). The entrances to the Old City may be subject to checks or closures.</p>\n\n<p>Street protests and demonstrations can also occur elsewhere in East Jerusalem. You should be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. You should check the local news in advance and avoid areas which have been the site of recent clashes or violence.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent incidents including terrorist attacks on public transport and near public transport lines in Jerusalem. Take extra care when using public transport in Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tel-aviv\">Tel Aviv</h3>\n\n<p>Take extra care when using public transport in Tel Aviv, in particular at transport hubs, and when using buses in the greater Tel Aviv area. You may wish to consider using other forms of transport.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been large political demonstrations across Israel, including in Tel Aviv. Entry/exit to Ben Gurion airport has occasionally been impacted. You should check the local news before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wider-israel\">Wider Israel</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks can occur anywhere in Israel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gaza\">Gaza</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Gaza (including the waters off Gaza). You should not approach the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0can no longer offer routine consular assistance in Gaza. If you travel to Gaza you should review your security arrangements regularly. Protests may occur in central Gaza City and along the perimeter fence with Israel. You should exercise extreme caution and avoid demonstrations or large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>The border crossings with Israel (Erez) and Egypt (Rafah) may close with no advance notice. Check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.</p>\n\n<p>During periods of conflict between the de facto Hamas authorities and the Israeli government, the Israeli Air Forces may launch air strikes against targets inside Gaza. There will be no warning siren inside Gaza and there are no official air raid shelters. You should take advice from locals about the safest place to shelter.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel/entry-requirements#entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</a></p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recognises the need for major international organisations to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction work and to engage in independent reporting and verification of the situation on the ground in Gaza. Medical and other essential specialist staff should co-ordinate their entry to and exit from Gaza with those organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Do not attempt to enter Gaza by sea, including via a flotilla. The Israeli Navy routinely patrols the area and have made clear that it will prevent any vessels attempting to breach the restrictions. You will be detained and deported, and your electronic equipment is likely to be confiscated. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> does not believe that humanitarian supplies should be delivered in this way. Anyone wishing to send humanitarian assistance or other goods to Gaza should do so through established channels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"occupied-golan-heights\">Occupied Golan Heights</h3>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 500m of the border with Syria (the \u2018Alpha Line\u2019).</p>\n\n<p>While the risks have decreased since Syrian Golan became more stable in 2018, rocket attacks and sporadic gunfire have occurred in northern Israel without warning since 2012. There is also a risk of falling debris from Israeli and Syrian air-defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Land mines have also been planted in lots of places across the Occupied Golan Heights, including near to populated areas and roads. These areas are usually marked, and are often fenced off. Follow established roads and paths, and do not hike off trail. If you are travelling in the region, follow advice from local law enforcement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-lebanon\">Border with Lebanon</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel within 5km of the border with Lebanon. The Israeli military have announced that the area is a closed military zone and entry into the area is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the Sheba\u2019a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the \u2018Blue Line\u2019) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town. If travelling near areas of military operation, adhere to all Israeli official instructions.</p>\n\n<p>The situation on the ground could change quickly. On 7 April 2023, Israel carried out strikes against targets in southern Lebanon in response to rockets launched on 6 April 2023 from southern Lebanon into Israel. On 20 July 2020 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line. You should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-with-egypt\">Border with Egypt</h3>\n\n<p>The security situation on the border with Egypt remains volatile. Take extra care and be vigilant when using Route 10 which runs along the Israeli border with Egypt and is subject to closures by the Israeli authorities. You may wish to consider using other routes.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent clashes between Israeli Security Forces and Palestinians in these areas and violent incidents can occur without warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"west-bank\">West Bank</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. There has been a heightened state of tension and violent clashes resulting in deaths in the West Bank since the outbreak of conflict on 7 October. .</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0There are road closures and numerous checkpoints across the West Bank. Travel in and out of the West Bank is not possible without passing through at least one Israeli military checkpoint. You will need a passport and immigration slip to go through these checkpoints. Checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. Please refer to the\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Access Coordination Unit</a>\u00a0for information (which is subject to change).</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities sometimes restrict movement in and out of the West Bank, either on Jewish High Holidays, Israeli national holidays or as a result of a security incident. This doesn\u2019t normally affect foreign nationals, but would affect dual Palestinian-British nationals. Road closures can occur with little notice. Keep up to date with local travel updates.</p>\n\n<p>The cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho see large numbers of tourists including on organised tours and there have been no recent reports of any serious incidents involving foreigners. However, take care when travelling anywhere in the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers. Check the local news before travelling to see if there have been recent clashes and avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.</p>\n\n<p>These incidents have occurred in Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, at Israeli checkpoints, around Palestinian refugee camps and along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis. Be vigilant, exercise caution, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow instructions of local authorities. Check the local news in advance and avoid travelling to areas which have been the site of recent violence. Exercise extreme caution when driving on these routes, particularly at night.</p>\n\n<p>Israelis living in the illegal settlements in the West Bank occasionally organise demonstrations in the West Bank which sometimes turn violent. There are also a number of reports of settlers threatening those travelling near to settlements and settlement outposts. Take particular care if you are near settlements, including those in the hills around Nablus and in the South Hebron hills and settlement outposts (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc). There is a closed military zone in the H2 area of Hebron (around Ash-Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs), where there is a risk of a hostile reaction from members of extremist groups.</p>\n\n<p>Due to a significant number of road traffic accidents involving taxis in the West Bank, you\u2019re advised not to use them where possible. Avoid using buses on the West Bank and keep in mind the difficulties and risks associated with travelling between Jerusalem/Ramallah via checkpoints and the risks associated with travelling along Route 60 (especially the junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>Due to restrictions on travel, the ability of the\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0to provide consular assistance in the West Bank may be limited. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recommends all British nationals in Israel and the OPTs register their presence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n<p>Most visits to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are trouble-free, but the theft of passports, credit cards, and valuables from public beaches is common. Keep your personal belongings in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>Crime is generally not a problem in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, but you should take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-security\">Passport security</h2>\n<p>A Serious Organised Crime Agency investigation into the misuse of UK passports in the murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in Dubai in January 2010 found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports. This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. Only hand your passport over to others (including Israeli officials) when absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is erratic, maintenance of public buses is variable, and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on roads within Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, and fines for speeding are high.</p>\n\n<p>If you intend to drive in the West Bank, check that you are insured before setting out. It may be easier to arrange West Bank insurance at a hire company in East Jerusalem than from the major hire car companies in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It is not safe to hitchhike in Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling to the desert, go with others, take a supply of water and a mobile phone, and let someone know your itinerary and expected time of return.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 there were 355 road deaths in the Israel (source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons\">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 3.9 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Our advice against all travel to the West Bank does not apply to Route 1 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</p>\n\n",

Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are ongoing Israeli air strikes into Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are very likely to continue with an increased threat of attacks, including by individuals acting alone.</p>\n\n<p>Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Old City in Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>government, military and police installations</li>\n  <li>security personnel including military and police</li>\n  <li>transport networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with Western interests</li>\n  <li>crowded places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack.

There is a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza and Hamas has reportedly taken hostages across the border and into the Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n",

You can find locations of ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and towns in travel guides and online.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid driving into ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of Jerusalem on Shabbat (from sunset on Friday to nightfall (approximately 1 hour after sunset) on Saturday).  If you attempt to drive into these areas local residents may throw stones at your car.</p>\n\n<p>During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset is forbidden for Muslims (though not for children under the age of 8). Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, you should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places in the Occupied Palestinian Territories during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year, you can look them up online. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/travelling-during-ramadan\">Travelling during Ramadan</a></p>\n\n<p>Be sensitive about taking pictures of people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. Don\u2019t take photographs of military or police personnel or installations.</p>\n\n<p>Carry identification with you at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details and entry stamp pages of your passport).</p>\n\n<p>The penalties for smuggling and trafficking in illegal drugs are severe. Those caught in possession can expect a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10 year prison sentence. Attitudes towards LGBT issues within some parts of Palestinian and Israeli society can be hostile. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention on the West Bank in more conservative Israeli areas, including ultra-Orthodox communities. Homosexuality is largely taboo in Palestinian society.</p>\n\n<p>Some Palestinian groups may violently oppose events, cultural events and demonstrations, which they consider to be inconsistent with their own values. This includes those perceived to be linked to the LGBT+ community, even if the event is not intended to promote LGBT+ rights. In these cases, the Palestinian security forces and police may not always act effectively to protect participants. You should be aware of these risks. You should liaise with the local authorities before planning or organising any event.</p>\n\n<p>Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT community and is famous for its annual Pride Parade. An annual Pride Parade is also held in Jerusalem, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing occurred during the 2015 parade. You should exercise extra vigilance if attending. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Israel is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you are caught breaking local laws on import and export of wild animals you can expect to receive a substantial fine and up to 2 years in prison.

If you\u2019re unsure how Israel and The Occupied Palestinian Territories\u2019 entry requirements apply to you, contact its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">UK embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"all-travellers\">All travellers</h2>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported. This process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country\u2019s immigration policy or procedures.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you\u2019re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.</p>\n\n<p>At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states \u2018Palestinian Authority only\u2019 or \u2018Judea and Samaria only\u2019. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2017, the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Contact the Israeli embassy</a> if you need further information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-other-countries\">Previous Travel to Other Countries</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">contact the Israeli embassy</a> prior to arrival.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"customs-and-immigration\">Customs and Immigration</h3>\n\n<p>It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. You may experience lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Searches and questioning may be longer in some cases, including but not limited to some visitors with Palestinian or Arab ancestry with evidence of previous travel which may be considered suspicious, or those who are considered to have publicly criticised the state of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Airside Immigration officials occasionally ask travellers to wait whilst further checks are conducted. This is not routine procedure, but a small number of travellers do experience delays, some for several hours. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can legally be refused entry if they have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or if they belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refusal-of-entry-into-israel\">Refusal of entry into Israel</h3>\n\n<p>If in the rare event you are refused entry to Israel you will be booked on the next available flight back to the port from which you entered Israel and on the same airline. Depending on the flight schedule you may be taken to the Immigration Detention Centre located a few minutes\u2019 drive from the airport. You will remain there until your flight departs. Whilst there you will have access to a telephone, information in English, and medical assistance if required. Your luggage will remain at the airport so you will need to highlight to officials if you need to retrieve anything urgent from your luggage, for example medication. The Embassy is contactable from the Detention Centre and can assist where possible. But the Embassy cannot intervene with immigration decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\">Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h3>\n\n<p>Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and Israeli immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs.</p>\n\n<p>On 20 October 2022, the Government of Israel introduced new requirements for foreign nationals entering and residing in the West Bank. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/departments/policies/judeaentry2022\">You can find more information on the requirements and points of contact for enquiries via the Israeli government website.</a></p>\n\n<p>Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that they are not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. This is unless they obtain advance authorisation from the Israeli \u2018Territory Actions Co-ordinator\u2019, violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>You may be detained on arrival to Israel and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you are entering Israel for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is not able to support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. If you decide to visit Gaza against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you will need to contact the relevant authorities well in advance. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is no longer able to provide administrative support for UK charities wishing to enter Gaza via the Rafah crossing. The Rafah border regularly closes with no warning and for long periods of time. The Erez border also sometimes closes with no warning. At these times it may be impossible to enter or leave Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli checkpoints may be closed during Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">Please refer to this website for information</a> (which is subject to change).\u00a0 For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"british-nationals-of-palestinian-origin\">British nationals of Palestinian origin</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a British national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave Gaza or the West Bank. If you are a British national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of British nationals of Palestinian origin or British nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h3>\n\n<p>British-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Allenby and Rafah border crossings (respectively) with Jordan and Egypt and return via the same route. Please note: British/Palestinian dual nationals entering Gaza, which is against our Travel Advice, should check with the relevant authorities on entry/exit procedures. Numbers of such dual nationals permitted to enter and exit Gaza via Erez are very limited and include medical, humanitarian cases and aid workers. The final decision on entry and exit permits via Erez always rests with the Israeli authorities</p>\n\n<p>If you are a dual national check with your nearest Israeli Embassy if pre-approval is required for travel to Israel. Dual nationals holding Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, and Lebanese citizenship have previously been impacted. If you are not a citizen of any of these countries, but have close family ties, it is also advisable to check with your nearest Israeli Embassy.</p>\n\n<p>Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19\">COVID-19</h2>\n\n<p>Entry requirements for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://corona.health.gov.il/en/abroad/\">the Ministry of Health</a> pages for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"children-and-young-people\">Children and young people</h2>\n\n<p>Minors (aged 17  years and under) travelling to Israel alone or with only one parent are advised to carry with them a letter from their parents or guardians confirming their approval, accommodation plans and contact details.</p>\n\n<p>Minors exiting Israel alone should carry a locally issued notarised letter as advised by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://lawoffice.org.il/en/unaccompanied-minors-traveling-abroad-from-israel/\">external firms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See \u2018Dual nationals\u2019 section above concerning children with Israeli parents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entry-via-land-borders\">Entry via Land Borders</h2>\n<p>You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/leaving-israel/#sea-and-land\">Israeli Ministry of Health\u2019s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those wishing to enter Jordan from Israel will need to register in advance.

On entry, visitors are granted permission to stay for a period of up to 3 months.
