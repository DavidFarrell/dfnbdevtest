You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arms-embargo\">Arms embargo</h3>\n\n<p>There is a UK arms embargo against Zimbabwe. It is an offence in UK law to take firearms into Zimbabwe, even if you plan to bring them back to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-and-out-of-zimbabwe\">Taking money into and out of Zimbabwe</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than 10,000 US dollars cash (or the same amount in other currencies), unless it is left over from funds you brought with you and declared on arrival.

Authorities have in the past used force to suppress them, including after post-election protests in August 2018 and fuel demonstrations in January 2019.\u00a0 Avoid political activity, or activities which could be considered political, including political discussions in public places or online.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to make derogatory or insulting comments about the President or to carry material considered to be offensive to the President\u2019s office.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blackouts-and-water-rationing\">Blackouts and water rationing</h2>\n\n<p>There are long power blackouts because of electricity shortages. During blackouts, traffic lights may not work. There is also water rationing in parts of the country.

People travelling alone may be more vulnerable. Mugging, pickpocketing and jewellery theft are common in city centres, especially after dark. Street lighting can be poor. Be vigilant when leaving banks and cash points. Do not carry or display large amounts of cash in public places.</p>\n\n<p>There have been occasional armed robberies targeting foreign residents. Make sure your accommodation is always secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>There have been thefts and smash-and-grab robberies from vehicles, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>at the main intersections along the route to Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport</li>\n  <li>along Liberation Legacy Way (Borrowdale Road) and Churchill Road in Harare</li>\n  <li>on the Masvingo-Beitbridge road</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be particularly vigilant when using these routes.

Do not leave your vehicle unattended in unguarded areas in towns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry a photocopy of your passport or your Zimbabwean resident ID at all times. Leave your original passport somewhere safe. If you lose your UK passport, get a police report. You may need to show this to immigration to explain why you have no proof of entry when you depart.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Zimbabwean laws on the possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict and carry heavy fines or prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>Zimbabwe\u2019s economic situation remains unpredictable. People use Zimbabwean and US dollars. This may change without notice. It is illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than officially licensed dealers such as banks or bureaux de change. Bureaux de change will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>There is a shortage of physical cash, so it\u2019s not always possible make withdrawals using an international debit or credit card. Change is rarely available, so carry small denomination notes.</p>\n\n<p>Check in advance what payment methods a restaurant, hotel or tour operator will accept. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may not accept credit or debit cards. Most suppliers prefer US dollars in cash.</p>\n\n<p>Check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean or US dollars, as the symbol for both is $. Check exchange rates before any transaction, as they are unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid being overcharged, make sure to say you\u2019re using an international bank card when paying in shops and restaurants. Also, make sure they charge you in the correct currency.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some challenges with international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photographs of government offices, airports, military establishments, official residences, embassies and other sensitive places without special permission from the Ministry of Information.

Laws are strictly enforced.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"state-house-in-harare\">State House in Harare</h3>\n\n<p>Armed members of the Presidential Guard patrol the area around State House in Harare (the President\u2019s official residence). They do not allow loitering by motorists, cyclists or pedestrians, and it is illegal to take photographs. The roads in this area are closed from 6pm to 6am. Do not use GPS navigation systems around the President\u2019s residence and, if possible, avoid the area altogether.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationality\">Dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Since 1984 it has been illegal to hold dual nationality. The Constitutional Court recently ruled that some categories of dual nationality are legal, and it is now possible for Zimbabwean citizens by birth to hold dual nationality. However, the legislation remains inconsistent, and the Zimbabwean authorities may obstruct, detain or even seek to prosecute someone they consider an offender. The British Embassy is not able to provide the full range of consular services to people with dual British and Zimbabwean nationality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pornographic-material\">Pornographic material</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to possess or import pornographic material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"jewellery\">Jewellery</h3>\n\n<p>Do not carry any precious or semi-precious stones without the correct paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence.

Be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted attention.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.

Check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.soaz.net/\">Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe</a> whether operators are trained and licensed. Animal attacks have injured and killed visitors. Treat wild animals with caution and respect and always keep a safe distance from them. Some activities, such as walking or canoe safaris, could pose risks to personal safety. Make sure your travel insurance covers all the activities you plan on doing in Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Zimbabwe, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need\u00a0either a 1968\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a>\u00a0or a UK driving licence\u00a0to drive in Zimbabwe. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit#bf-full-width\">find your nearest post office branch</a>\u00a0that offers this service.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Zimbabwe with a UK driving licence for up to 12 months. Make sure you have copies of your passport\u2019s photo page and visa with you in the car at all times. Be ready to show ID if asked and keep the originals in a safe place where you can get them easily.</p>\n\n<p>Obey police signals, stop at roadblocks and tollgates. Make sure you get a receipt if you are asked to pay any fine.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is very poor in Zimbabwe. Traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury. Hazards include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deep potholes</li>\n  <li>broken traffic lights</li>\n  <li>poorly lit vehicles (including heavy good vehicles and cyclists)</li>\n  <li>poorly lit roads</li>\n  <li>badly marked roads</li>\n  <li>stray livestock</li>\n  <li>pedestrians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Emergency services may provide very limited help in the event of an accident, and ambulances are often delayed.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always wear a seatbelt</li>\n  <li>lock car doors</li>\n  <li>avoid driving outside main towns at night</li>\n  <li>travel carefully on roads between cities</li>\n  <li>carry a comprehensive medical kit</li>\n  <li>be careful about stopping at laybys</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plan carefully before setting out on long-distance journeys. Get local advice about any places you plan to visit. Fuel is sometimes unavailable and there may be queues. Carry extra fuel or top up your tank whenever possible. Before you pay for fuel, check if you can pay with an international card.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to continue driving when the President\u2019s motorcade goes past, no matter which side of the road you\u2019re on. If you see the motorcade, pull off the road or on to the side of the road if this is not possible. The security forces have assaulted people for stopping in the wrong place or for not stopping soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re resident in Zimbabwe, you may want to get a Zimbabwean licence to minimise the chance of problems at roadblocks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re bringing a vehicle not registered in Zimbabwe into the country, you must have a police vehicle clearance certificate (temporary import permit).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bus-travel\">Bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Commuter buses (\u2018combis\u2019) are often overcrowded, inadequately maintained, uninsured and recklessly driven. Avoid them if possible. Larger intercity buses may also be poorly driven. There have been serious road accidents involving long-distance buses travelling at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxis recommended by hotels are usually reliable and in good condition. Major hotels usually have their own taxis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>) lists all known airlines in Zimbabwe that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to and from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the\u00a0Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>British government employees travelling to and within Zimbabwe have been advised to use carriers that are not on the UK <abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The rail system in Zimbabwe is underdeveloped and very poorly maintained. Level crossings are poorly marked, resulting in many accidents. Passenger services are currently suspended. Check with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nrz.co.zw/\">National Railways of Zimbabwe</a> for updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season runs from November to April.
