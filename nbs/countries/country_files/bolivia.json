Thieves work in teams to distract their victims.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks on lone travellers taking motorbike taxis have been reported at tourist sites such as Rurrenabaque.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"express-kidnapping-and-scams\">Express kidnapping and scams</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of \u2018express kidnapping\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 short-term, opportunistic abduction aimed at extracting cash. Victims are held hostage for up to several days while criminals use stolen bank or credit cards.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors are particularly vulnerable when entering Bolivia at overland border points with Peru, Chile and Argentina. If you\u2019re travelling from Copacabana to La Paz, try to use a direct bus.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several incidents at the Cementerio General area in La Paz and in the Sopocachi area of La Paz.</p>\n\n<p>Express kidnappers sometimes impersonate police officers to target foreigners. They have used fake police ID cards, uniforms and even police stations to fool victims. One of the criminals pretends to be a friendly tourist. A fake police officer then approaches and asks for passports and other information. The impostors persuade the victim to get into a taxi driven by another criminal, where they rob them, sometimes by taking them to ATMs to withdraw money.</p>\n\n<p>Call the Tourist Police on 800-14-0081 (toll-free) if you suspect impostors are targeting you. The police cannot search you without a written order from a state prosecutor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There have been rape and sexual assault incidents at clubs and hostels. Be cautious if you\u2019re approached by strangers. Lock your room when you return to your hotel or hostel.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prison-tours\">Prison tours</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid prison tours. They\u2019re illegal and unsafe. There are no guarantees for your safety inside prisons.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h2>\n\n<p>Police and immigration officials sometimes carry out ID checks. Carry copies of the photo page from your passport and the Bolivian entry stamps. Leave the original document in a safe place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-bars\">Illegal bars</h3>\n\n<p>There are illegal bars in Bolivia. If the police find you at one, you may be detained for questioning, particularly if drugs are found at the premises.\u00a0Legal bars close at 3am.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Bolivia is the world\u2019s third largest producer of cocaine. There are harsh penalties for those caught trafficking or in possession. The minimum sentence is 8 years and prison conditions are very poor. Never leave luggage unattended when departing the country and avoid any contact with illegal drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ayahuasca-ceremonies\">Ayahuasca ceremonies</h3>\n\n<p>Ayahuasca is a traditional plant used in \u2018spiritual cleansing\u2019 ceremonies by indigenous communities in Bolivia, primarily in the Amazon region, but also near La Paz. At these ceremonies people consume a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogenic drug. It is not illegal to consume this brew, but its interaction with existing medical conditions is not well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after consuming it. Some Ayahuasca retreats are in remote areas, making it difficult to get medical help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-remote-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in remote areas</h3>\n\n<p>Be careful travelling with cameras and binoculars in remote areas, particularly in coca-growing areas such as the Chapare and the Yungas, where people can be suspicious of anyone taking photographs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check before taking photographs of local people.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal. However, same-sex relationships are frowned on by many Bolivians, more so in the Altiplano than in Santa Cruz, where attitudes tend to be more liberal.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Adventure activities in Bolivia include mountain biking, salt flat tours and jungle expeditions. There are no official minimum standards for tour operators. Get local advice and only use reputable\u00a0companies. Check your travel insurance policy covers you for the activities you\u2019re planning.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re mountain biking on the so-called \u2018Death Road\u2019, from La Paz to Coroico through the Yungas Valley, make sure the bikes are in good condition. Check your guide is carrying safety equipment and first-aid kit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Bolivia, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have both a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car to drive in Bolivia. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> in person from some UK post offices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit\">find your nearest post office branch that offers this service</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel can be dangerous due to poor road conditions and low driving standards. Serious accidents happen on the main tourist routes. Some of Bolivia\u2019s main highways are paved but most roads are unpaved rough tracks.</p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season (November to March) there is a risk of landslides and roads can be blocked. Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/\">road status updates from the Bolivian road authority</a> (in Spanish) and get local advice before you set out.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles are often not well maintained. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often needed, especially during the rainy season. Broken-down vehicles with no warning lights are a frequent hazard on roads at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-taxis\">Buses and taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Several recent accidents involving public transport, especially long-distance buses, have affected British people. Bus drivers drive for longer than would be permitted under European laws.</p>\n\n<p>Many taxis and most bus companies do not meet European standards and rarely have seatbelts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-blockades\">Road blockades</h3>\n\n<p>Groups often use road blockades as a form of protest, without warning. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and do not attempt to cross blockades. Blockades can disrupt public transport at very short notice. Strikes may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from airports. Check <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/\">road status updates from the Bolivian road authority</a> (in Spanish) to see which roads are blocked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Many of Bolivia\u2019s airports lack safety and rescue capability. Airports outside the departmental capitals are less likely to possess fire and rescue equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-and-river-travel\">Lake and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>The boat trips on Lake Titicaca offer boats that are often very basic. The same is true of boats used for river excursions in jungle areas. Check life jackets are provided.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding-and-landslides\">Flooding and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>Floods and landslides are common, particularly in mountainous areas during the rainy season (November to March). Roads are often impassable for days at a time.</p>\n\n",
