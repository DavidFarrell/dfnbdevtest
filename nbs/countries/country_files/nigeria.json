Most visits are trouble-free, but a small number of British people encounter problems. You should take sensible precautions to protect your safety.</p>\n\n<p>The Nigeria-Niger land border has been closed and commercial flights between Nigeria and Niger have been prohibited by the Nigerian authorities, in response to the political situation in Niger. Flight times between Nigeria and other neighbouring countries may also be affected. See Local Travel.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Nigeria. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>. Most attacks occur in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States in the North East. There have also been significant attacks in other states, including in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Bauchi, Taraba, Kogi, Niger, and the Federal Capital Territory. Further attacks are likely and could occur at any time. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could affect western interests as well as places visited by tourists. Attacks are more likely to attack crowded locations or symbolic targets, such as places of worship. There is a heightened risk during religious events, public holidays or election periods.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of criminal and terrorist kidnap throughout Nigeria.

Kidnapping, violent crime, and inter-communal violence occurs throughout all regions of Nigeria. Other threats, such as terrorism and militant groups, are heightened in specific regions. Refer to local travel below for <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> guidance in the region you are travelling or working in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"south-west\">South West</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime such as mugging, kidnapping, car-jacking and armed robberies are common, particularly in the larger cities. Large scale attacks are rare in the region but Islamic State West Africa has claimed two attacks in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">see terrorism for further detail</a>. Intercommunal violence is prevalent. Whilst these attacks have not targeted foreign nationals, caution should be exercised to avoid being caught up in such incidents.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times and take into account any security advice given by your hotel, employer or your hosts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"south-east-and-south-south\">South East and South South</h3>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all travel to the riverine areas (ie the river and swamp locations accessible by boat, but not by road) of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River States.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all but essential travel to Abia, Anambra and Imo States and non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers States.</p>\n\n<p>Militant groups are active across the Niger Delta region and have carried out a number of attacks on oil and gas infrastructure. There\u2019s a high risk of armed robbery, criminality and criminal kidnap in the Niger Delta region.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South East and South South regions of Nigeria. Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas.  There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders.  A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews.</p>\n\n<p>Secessionist groups are active in the South East and attacks and violent clashes often occur with the military and other security forces. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-central-and-the-federal-capital-territory-including-abuja\">North Central and the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to Niger, Kogi, and Plateau States due to criminal and militant activity and incidents of inter-communal violence.</p>\n\n<p>The outer suburbs of Abuja, within the Federal Capital Territory can be prone to varying levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity is unpredictable. Violent crime, often involving firearms, has also increased in recent months and has spread from the outer suburbs to more central and wealthier areas of the city.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of terrorism in Abuja and the Federal Capital Territory area has increased in 2022. Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for attacks, including an attack on Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital during which an unknown number of prisoners escaped, including suspected terrorists. The risk is present across the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja, and particularly in the border areas of the Federal Capital Territory.\u00a0For information on terrorism, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">see Terrorism page</a></p>\n\n<p>You should be cautious and vigilant when travelling in the Federal Capital Territory, take advice from trusted contacts, and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular protests in Abuja, which have the potential to turn violent.  You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-west\">North West</h3>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all travel to Kaduna State, Katsina State, and Zamfara State.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advise against all but essential travel to: Kano State, Jigawa State, and Sokoto State; and within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State.</p>\n\n<p>Banditry and violent attacks are frequent in the region and there is a high threat of kidnap. Incidents of inter-communal violence occur and trains are vulnerable to attack. If you\u2019re travelling in the North West against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you should exercise extreme caution and monitor local media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-east\">North East</h3>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all travel to Borno State, Yobe State, Adamawa State, Gombe State.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advises against all but essential travel to Bauchi and Taraba States.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high and increasing threat from extremists linked to Boko Haram or Islamic State West Africa, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas and large gatherings. Humanitarian personnel, vehicles, supplies and infrastructure can be targeted by terrorists and criminals. For recent attacks, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">see Terrorism</a>. Further attacks may occur without warning.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnap, violent attacks and inter-communal tensions which can lead to outbreaks of violence. During the dry season (which normally runs from around October to March) this risk is likely to be heightened.</p>\n\n<p>Regular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. There is a risk of retaliatory attacks.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the North East against\u00a0<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u00a0advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date. If you are working, you should be fully confident in your employer\u2019s ability to extract you in the event of any emergency. If in Maiduguri you should be aware that if security were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nigeria-borders\">Nigeria borders</h3>\n\n<p>The Nigeria-Niger land border has been closed by the Nigerian authorities in response to the political situation in Niger. Additional checks are in place at the Nigeria-Benin, Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Cameroon land borders. If you\u2019re planning to make a land crossing from Nigeria, check with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-demonstrations-and-intercommunal-violence\">Protests, demonstrations and intercommunal violence</h2>\n\n<p>Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can occur with little notice throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant and take local advice on areas to avoid. Take particular care if you\u2019re visiting crowded public places or attending events which attract large crowds. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don\u2019t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of inter-communal violence occur frequently throughout Nigeria. Attacks can occur without warning. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of terrorist and criminal kidnaps in Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time, with an increased risk in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the northern and middle belt states of Adamawa,  Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Nassarawa, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba, Benue, Yobe and Zamfara</li>\n  <li>the Niger Delta states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Imo and Rivers</li>\n  <li>Edo State</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminal groups target whole communities or individuals. Kidnaps are sometimes take place along major highways, such as the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna highway and Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway in Anambra.</p>\n\n<p>On 16 May 2023 a US diplomatic convoy was attacked and people were kidnapped in Anambra State in the Ogbaru area, close to Delta state. The incident is under investigation.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping and other armed attacks targeting oil and gas facilities and workers in the Niger Delta region. This also applies to facilities at sea.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers wishing to travel to any of the locations above should be alert to the threat of kidnap, and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting.</p>\n\n<p>The great majority of kidnapping victims remain ordinary Nigerians. Foreigners as well as Nigerian businessmen, traditional rulers and politicians are often targeted in the expectation of a high ransom reward. When arranging meetings in Nigeria make sure those who attend are known to you and hold the meeting at a secure location.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals may be targeted. Foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped in the past, and in some cases killed.  British nationals of Nigerian origin visiting friends and relatives are often perceived as being wealthier than locals and are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. There is a possibility that criminal groups would sell hostages on to terrorist organisations. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"curfews-and-telecommunication-blackouts\">Curfews and telecommunication blackouts</h2>\n\n<p>Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to comply with all curfews and movement restrictions could put you at significant risk. You should check with the local authorities or someone with local knowledge for up to date information on curfews and restrictions before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Telecommunication operators in Nigeria have in the past been ordered to suspend services in certain areas, including mobile telecommunications and WiFi. Future shutdowns may happen at short notice and may also be extended to new areas without advanced notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maritime-security\">Maritime security</h2>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies and incidents of piracy in Nigerian waters, the wider Gulf of Guinea, and on the rivers and harbours in the Niger Delta area. Mariners should seek professional security advice, be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robbery.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals as their perceived wealth makes them an attractive victim.</p>\n\n<p>You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends and family, follow the security guidance offered by employers or hosts and limit road travel at night as far as possible. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don\u2019t wear valuable watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value. If you suspect danger, move to a safer area.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re caught up in an armed robbery, you should immediately comply with the attackers\u2019 demands.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities.  Scams can pose great financial risk to victims. You should be very cautious about any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. You can read more about scam or \u2018419\u2019 emails and letters on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud-az-419\">Action Fraud website.</a></p>\n\n<p>If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Nigeria you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>People have received scam e-mails claiming to be from a British High Commission office in Nigeria. If you receive an email that appears to be from any British High Commission office in Nigeria asking for bank details or money, you should immediately contact the Consular Section of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-abuja#contact-us\">British Deputy High Commission</a> in Lagos.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re considering fertility treatment in Nigeria, you should be cautious. There have been a number of staged fake births (commonly called \u2018miracle babies\u2019) which result in visitors being falsely led to believe they have given birth. You should be aware of the risks associated with bringing a child who is not biologically related to you into the UK without following appropriate legal procedures. The UK has restricted <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-adoption/adopting-a-child-from-overseas\">overseas adoption of children</a> from Nigeria.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Road travel across Nigeria can be chaotic and slow moving. You should take a mobile telephone and a supply of bottled water with you when travelling by car.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Nigeria with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you\u2019re staying longer, you will need to get a Nigerian Driver\u2019s Licence. You can contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nigeriadriverslicence.org/\">Federal Road Safety Corp</a> on their website.</p>\n\n<p>You should limit travel after dark outside city centres as far as possible; and avoid quiet and poorly lit roads. You should be particularly vigilant when sitting in traffic jams or at traffic lights. Keep car windows up and doors locked, and make sure valuables are out of sight. If you feel your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest place of safety (eg the nearest police station).</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care when driving outside cities and consider travelling in convoy and avoid travel after dark.</p>\n\n<p>In Lagos, eating, smoking or using a mobile phone while driving and riding a motorcycle without a helmet are prohibited. Motorists face fines or imprisonment for violations.</p>\n\n<p>There are authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. You should slow down at any type of checkpoint and use common sense at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in Northern Nigeria. This includes attacks on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent reports of robberies and car-jackings, some involving armed gunmen, on Nigeria\u2019s urban and rural road network.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport throughout Nigeria is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Most major hotels offer cars for hire with drivers. You should use these where possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you are expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at any of Nigeria\u2019s international airports, make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. Bogus greeters are a problem.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>Commercial flights between Nigeria and Niger have been prohibited by the Nigerian authorities in response to the political situation in Niger. If you\u2019re planning to travel to or from Niger, check the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>\u2019s Niger travel page or with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling. Flight times between Nigeria and other neighbouring countries may also be affected.\nYou can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5N\">website of the Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx\">IATA Operational Safety Audit</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/issa/Pages/registry.aspx?Query=all\">IATA Standard Safety Assessment</a>. These lists aren\u2019t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>Med-View airline has been <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1277_en.htm\">refused permission to operate services to the EU</a>  due to safety deficiencies. However, Med-View airline may continue to operate services to the EU using aircraft leased from other airlines.

Attacks could be indiscriminate and could affect western interests, as well as places visited by tourists and foreign nationals resident in Nigeria. Further attacks are likely and could occur at any time, including around religious or other public holidays or during election periods.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on\u00a0<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a>\u00a0and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from\u00a0terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Most attacks are conducted by Boko Haram or Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and occur in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States in the North East. There have also been significant attacks in other states, including in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Bauchi and Taraba States.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of terrorism across Nigeria includes the capital city Abuja, and the surrounding Federal Capital Territory area. This risk has increased in 2022. Since May 2022 Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) have conducted a number of attacks in Kogi, Niger, and in the Federal Capital Territory. The risk is present across the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja, and particularly in the border areas of the Federal Capital Territory.</p>\n\n<p>Public places where crowds gather have been targeted in the past, including places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, football viewing centres, displacement camps, transport terminals (including train networks), government buildings, security and educational institutions (schools, further education colleges and universities are all regular targets), and international organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included coordinated armed assaults, rocket attacks, assassinations, kidnapping, use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), bombings (including by child and female bombers), car bombings and arson. Use of military uniforms and vehicles have been used as a tactic to get close to the intended target.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have been known to construct illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes, such as the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road.</p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian staff and assets, civilians and aid workers have been targeted, especially in the North East, including in garrison towns and on roads. Humanitarian sites have also been targeted.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid places where there are political or other large public gatherings. Be vigilant, remain alert and pay attention to your surroundings at all times. You should follow local news reports and be alert to developments particularly around religious and public holidays. A heavy security presence often indicates areas of particularly high risk. You should avoid affected areas in the immediate aftermath of an attack. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to only travel during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>On 5 July 2022 the Kuje Prison in The Federal Capital Territory was bombed and attacked by gunmen and an unknown number of prisoners have escaped. Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>On 22 September 2022, a police patrol was attacked by gunmen in Ondo state, and on 23 September 2022, security personnel were attacked by gunmen in Edo state. Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility.</li>\n  <li>On 28 July 2022, a Nigerian military checkpoint in Niger state, 30km from Abuja, was attacked.</li>\n  <li>Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for killings of policemen in Suleja, Niger State, on 12 May and 4 July 2022. Suleja is less than 20 kilometres away from the Federal Capital Territory.</li>\n  <li>Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for an IED attack on a bar in Kabba, Kogi State, on 29 May 2022.</li>\n  <li>In April 2022, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) claimed two improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Iware and Jalingo, Taraba State, and in May 2022 claimed an attack against a military facility in Jalingo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorist-kidnaps\">Terrorist kidnaps</h2>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWA, are highly likely to carry out kidnaps in Nigeria. Kidnappings are widespread and could occur anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru, Boko Haram and ISWA have carried out a number of kidnaps in Nigeria. Several foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been kidnapped in the north of Nigeria, including in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Katsina, Kano and Kebbi. Some victims of kidnap, including two British nationals, have been killed by their captors. There may be an increased risk of kidnap, particularly to NGO workers, in Gwoza and Bama local government areas, Borno State. ISWA has also targeted foreigners for kidnap in south Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism, government or business sectors. If you\u2019re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>You should exercise vigilance when travelling, when in crowded public places, including religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, transport hubs and camps for displaced people. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to travel only during daylight hours.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking.  The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorist-groups-operating-in-nigeria\">Terrorist groups operating in Nigeria</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"boko-haram-and-islamic-state-west-africa-iswa\">Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA)</h3>\n\n<p>Boko Haram or JASDJ is an Islamist terrorist group operating in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The group aspire to establish a Sharia State in Nigeria and West Africa, de-stabilise the Nigerian government and remove western influence from the country.</p>\n\n<p>The group was formerly linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). On 12 March 2015, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) accepted a pledge of allegiance by Boko Haram. In August 2016, the group split into 2 factions: Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and JASDJ or Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>ISWA is affiliated with ISIS core in Iraq and Syria and has expressed an intention to target Nigerian government, Christian and western interests. ISWA have launched a series of successful attacks against Nigerian military locations, increased their freedom of movement across Borno and Yobe states, and taken multiple hostages.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ansarul-muslimina-fi-biladis-sudan-vanguard-for-the-protection-of-muslims-in-black-africa-ansaru\">Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan (Vanguard for the protection of Muslims in Black Africa) (Ansaru)</h3>\n\n<p>Ansaru is an Islamist terrorist organisation based in northern Nigeria, and is proscribed by the UK. It emerged in 2012 and is motivated by an anti-Nigerian Government and anti-Western agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Ansaru is broadly aligned with Al Qaeda. Since 2012, the group has kidnapped at least 8 hostages, mainly Europeans. They are believed to have killed a number of hostages, including 2 British nationals.</p>\n",
