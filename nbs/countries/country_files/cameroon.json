Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days.</p>\n\n<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are increasingly being used by non-state armed groups and have previously been used to target civilians in the North West and South West regions. They have also been used in the Far North region. There have also been a number of reported civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints due to accidental discharge of weapons.  If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Far North, North West and South West regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements. See [the safety and security section] (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security)</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should enhance your vigilance and plan your movements carefully. In November 2020, a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaound\u00e9, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2022, a number of IEDs were detonated in Mokolo market in Yaound\u00e9 across successive weeks resulting in the injury of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This follows small IEDs being detonated in populated areas of Yaound\u00e9 and Douala between June 2020 and February 2021. It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaound\u00e9 and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.\nBoko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon\u2019s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon, there is now an even greater likelihood of this occurring given the ongoing insecurity in that country. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.

Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need treatment of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the items (PPE bedding etc) and drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated. Not all pharmacies are open after 8pm. Pharmacies on call will usually have a display sign on the windows or doors.

                    "body": "<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Mugging and armed robbery are a problem throughout Cameroon but particularly in the cities Yaound\u00e9, Douala, Ngaoundere and Bafoussam.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid isolated or poorer areas of towns; e.g. in Yaound\u00e9, Briqueterie and Mokolo market, and in Douala, Nkololun, New Bell, Akwa, Bonaberi and Village. Be vigilant when walking around, particularly alone and avoid walking around at night.</p>\n\n<p>Be vigilant in public places. Trouble can flare up unexpectedly. Make sure car doors are locked when driving around. Avoid wearing jewellery, keep mobile phones out of sight and only carry small amounts of cash and valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Close and lock all doors and windows, particularly at night. Make sure burglar proof metal bars are installed. Identify callers through spy holes before opening doors, especially late at night.</p>\n\n<p>Petty theft is common on trains, coaches and bush taxis and around bus stations and hotels. Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes and many do not meet basic safety requirements. There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. You should not use taxis that you hail from the roadside (these are yellow in Yaound\u00e9 and Douala). Only use trusted, pre-arranged taxis and preferably book one from your hotel or restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>Car-jackings, kidnappings and armed robberies have occurred along roads close to the borders with Central African Republic (CAR), Chad and Nigeria, and along the Bamenda-Banyo, Bafoussam-Banyo, Bafoussam-Doula and Yaound\u00e9-Garoua Boulai-Ngaoundere roads. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon. Following the disputed election result in CAR in December 2020, and consequent insecurity in that country, there is now an even greater likelihood of this violence spilling over.</p>\n\n<p>Criminality by large gangs and hostage taking for ransom are also a threat more widely in Adamawa region. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing five people.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of kidnapping and hostage taking in the Far North, North, Adamawa, East, North West and South West regions of Cameroon. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors and residents are often targets of scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can cause significant financial loss. Scammers also target individuals and companies in the UK via websites, chat-rooms and by email. Advance fee scams are common in Cameroon. Cases involving the alleged adoption of children have been reported. Be very cautious about sending money or travelling to Cameroon to adopt a child where the information has come from a website or through emails. Cameroon does not have adoption agencies. Many victims are persuaded to pay large amounts of money before they suspect anything.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to contact the Police, call 117. If you have been a victim of fraud from a police official, you should call 1500. If you need to contact the fire service, call 118.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-travel\">Local travel</h2>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are active in the Far North. There is also a general threat of kidnapping, criminality and armed banditry.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the High Commission to offer consular services in the Far North, North and Adamawa regions is limited.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to within 40 km of the border with Chad because of armed banditry, including poachers in Bouba Ndjida National Park in the North region.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to within 40 km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR). There have been incursions by armed men from CAR and there have been fatalities. Armed banditry and kidnapping remains a risk.</p>\n\n<p>Take great care if you travel to the northern regions of Cameroon by road. The eastern route via Garoua-Boulai and Meiganga involves driving close to the border with CAR. The western route needs travel along the Bamenda-Banyo axis. The central route via Yoko requires travel on very poorly maintained roads through largely uninhabited areas, crossing a number of bridges in a poor state of repair. There is no fuel available on the route. If you must attempt this drive, carry plenty of water, sufficient fuel to enable you to turn back if necessary, a spare tyre and a satellite phone or VHF radio to summon assistance if needed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"north-west-and-south-west-anglophone-regions\">North West and South West (Anglophone) regions</h3>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to the North West and South West regions, except Limbe and the 35km stretch of N3 road connecting Limbe to the Littoral region in Fako division, where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel.</p>\n\n<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are being used by non-state armed groups, sometimes to target civilians, in the North West and South West regions. There have also been a number of civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints run by either NSAGs or government forces. You should exercise caution when approaching any road block, whether formal or informal.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2019, a local commercial air carrier (Camair-Co) was hit by gunshots while flying into Bamenda Airport in the North West region. You should follow the advice of the local security authorities and/or your tour operator if you\u2019re thinking about taking this route.</p>\n\n<p>General strikes (or \u2018ghost towns\u2019) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including (around Youth Day, 11 February), May (around National Day on 20 May) and October (around 1 October). Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. You should be vigilant, monitor local media and avoid travelling within the region on such days.</p>\n\n<p>There have been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over recent years in many places in the North West and South West regions. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings are in place in some areas. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula. Cameroon\u2019s Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) patrol the waters. The ferry that operates between Limbe/Tiko in Cameroon and Calabar in Nigeria passes through areas where pirates operate. The Bakassi Peninsula is made up of mangrove forests and isolated islands that are difficult to police. Mariners should seek professional security advice and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lake-nyos\">Lake Nyos</h3>\n\n<p>Lake Nyos in the North West Region emitted carbon dioxide in 1986, suffocating about 1,700 people. There were no warning signs that this would happen. Although now closely monitored, this situation could repeat with limited warning. There is also a concern that the wall of the volcanic dam holding back Lake Nyos is not sufficiently strong. Nearby Lake Mounoun is also saturated with carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There are occasional isolated incidents of political unrest around the country. You should remain vigilant, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.</p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. In late November 2020 a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaound\u00e9, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2022, a number of IEDs were detonated in Mokolo market in Yaound\u00e9 across a number of weeks resulting in the injury of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>On 21 February 2021, a small IED was detonated in Etoudi market in Yaound\u00e9. There were no deaths, though some individuals were reportedly injured.  On 31 January 2021 a small IED was detonated in Douala, injuring two people, who were almost certainly the perpetrators. In November 2020, an attempt was made to detonate an IED near the rail junction in Bonab\u00e9ri, west of Douala. In the same month a small IED also detonated in the Obobogo-Columbia neighbourhood of Yaound\u00e9. Several other IEDs were detonated in Yaound\u00e9 in June, July and August 2020.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future.  You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h2>\n\n<p>Avoid all travel by road at night in rural areas, particularly on the Yaound\u00e9-Douala road, where the road quality and visibility are poor, and accidents are common. Plan your journey carefully and travel in convoy, where possible. As mobile phone coverage is limited on this and certain other inter-city roads, you should consider taking a VHF radio or satellite phone.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive using a UK driving licence or <a href=\"/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">International Driving Permit</a> on first arrival.  If staying for more than six months, you should obtain a Cameroonian licence from the Delegation of Transport as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you\u2019re hiring a driver and car, make sure you\u2019re not liable for any accident or\u00a0damage.</p>\n\n<p>Roads in Cameroon are generally in poor condition. Many are badly pot-holed. Street lighting, where it exists, is poor. Pedestrians and stray animals on roads are a hazard. Many vehicles are poorly lit and badly driven.</p>\n\n<p>Roadblocks set up by the police or gendarmerie are common throughout Cameroon. You may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents. There are regular reports of uniformed members of the security forces stopping motorists on the pretext of minor or non-existent violations of local vehicle regulations in order to extort small bribes. Do not pay bribes; instead, ask the officer to provide a ticket, setting out the alleged offence so that you can pay at a local court.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h2>\n\n<p>There is only one local airline operating between a few of the major cities: Camair-co.  Scheduled flights are subject to frequent delays and cancellations.  Due to aviation safety standards, we advise against taking flights that use the XIAN MA-60, which is used occasionally for internal flights.  Several international airlines fly into Cameroon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h2>\n\n<p>There is a railway from Douala-Yaound\u00e9-Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9 and is considered a reliable means of transport. Details of services and times are on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.camrail.net/en/h_dla_yde.html\">Camrail website</a>.

In August 2016, the group split into two factions: Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and JASDJ or Boko Haram.

Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs \u2013 a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need drugs of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated.
