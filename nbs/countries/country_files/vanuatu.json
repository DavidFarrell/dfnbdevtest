Street crime is also increasing and you should avoid making yourself an easy target, especially at night. There have been a number of attacks on tourists at nightclubs and bars in Port Vila. Check with the Vanuatu Tourist Office or your hotel on places where extra caution is required.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several serious attacks on foreigners, including lone women, in isolated locations. Avoid visiting remote tourist sites or beaches alone. Where possible, travel as part of a larger group.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Before you travel, make copies of your passport and travel documents.

Inter-island boats should\u00a0have a current sea-worthiness certificate, but many do not.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>Take care if swimming in the sea as rip currents can be strong. Coral reefs can easily cause cuts and scrapes. There are reports of water quality issues in some of the lagoons and sharks have been known to be present in the waters off Vanuatu.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports</h3>\n\n<p>Many visitors to Vanuatu take part in water sports, including scuba diving and snorkelling without incident. However, deaths and serious accidents have occurred because of the lack of basic safety measures.

However, clubs bars and hotels may serve alcohol during these times.</p>\n\n<p>Drug offences are punishable by fines, imprisonment or both.
