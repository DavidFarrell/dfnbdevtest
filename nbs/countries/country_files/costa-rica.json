If you think a collision was a deliberate act by another driver to make you stop, drive on until you reach a safe place like a police station or garage. You will need to be able to explain your actions to the traffic police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spiked-drinks-and-sexual-assault\">Spiked drinks and sexual assault\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Rapes and sexual assaults have increased, some of which appear targeted toward tourists.

Criminal gangs have apparently used methanol in the manufacture of cheap brands of local spirits, including vodka and \u2018guaro\u2019 (cane liquor). You should take care when buying spirit-based drinks.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) says that methanol can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and can seriously damage the optic nerve. Chronic exposure may cause respiratory or cardiac failure. If you, or someone you are travelling with, shows signs of methanol poisoning, seek immediate medical attention.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences\u00a0\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>As a foreigner, you must carry ID such as a passport.

The Costa Rican authorities treat the possession of drugs and drug trafficking severely. The minimum sentence is 8 years imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica is generally welcoming of LGBT+ travellers.

Seek reliable local advice. Drownings are the second most common cause of accidental death and in recent years have averaged 50 to 60 per year, a third of whom were tourists.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care if participating in tours involving snorkelling or similar activities. There have been recent fatalities.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are regular sightings of crocodiles along the Pacific coast near beaches popular with surfers, from Playa Azul down to Playa Esterillos, and there have been attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Safety standards for adventure activities and on small boats are variable. There have been several incidents involving small boats in the Tortuguero area, including a fatality due to a falling tree. If you plan to take part any of these activities, use an established company with experienced staff.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainforest-tours\">Rainforest tours\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting jungle areas, go with an experienced local guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-\">Transport risks \u00a0</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to drive in Costa Rica, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Private cars are only allowed to enter the capital of San Jos\u00e9 on certain weekdays, allocated using the last digit of the licence plate number. Your hire car company can give you more details.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Costa Rica for up to 3 months. Even if you have been granted a longer stay, of up to 180 days, you cannot use your UK licence for longer than three months from your date of entry. An amendment to the law is in process but has not been ratified.</p>\n\n<p>If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a>\u00a0or get an\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit</a>. Border authorities may refuse entry to right-hand drive vehicles as they\u2019re illegal and do not qualify for local insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers cause accidents by speeding, overtaking irresponsibly or ignoring traffic lights. Take care when approaching bridges over the road as these often narrow the road to a single lane.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally good on main routes. However, in the rainy season, heavy rains can cause potholes and landslides that block the roads.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident where somebody has been injured or where the other driver does not accept blame, you must not move your vehicle until the traffic police have arrived. Contact the traffic police (\u2018transito\u2019 \u2013 telephone: 2222 9330 or 2222 9245) and the insurance investigator (INS \u2013 telephone: 800 800 8000) immediately.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid using unofficial taxis (\u2018taxi piratas\u2019). Official taxis are red (or orange at the airport) with a triangular sticker and plastic box on the roof with the name and number of the taxi company. It\u2019s best to use radio-dispatched taxis. Make sure the driver\u2019s ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters\u00a0</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season usually runs from June to November \u2013 the same as the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Monitor the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a> forecasts and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://severeweather.wmo.int/tc/cgn/index.html\">World Meteorological Organization warnings</a>. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. Keep up to date with <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\u00a0\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice and social media. Plan any local travel carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding\u00a0\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>The June-November period is also the peak rainy season. Flooding and landslides may occur, resulting in road closures and driving hazards.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes: movements greater than magnitude 6 occur periodically. Local infrastructure is well-prepared, and earthquakes seldom have widespread effects. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about\u202f<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>\u202for a\u202f<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/tsunamis\">tsunami</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions\u00a0</h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica has 16 volcanoes, several of which are considered active. The risk of eruptions is always present. The most recent significant eruption was at Volcan Rincon de la Vieja on 21 April 2023.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to any areas around volcanoes. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there\u2019s increased risk of lava flows.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ivhhn.org/\">affect air quality and have an impact on health</a>. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",
