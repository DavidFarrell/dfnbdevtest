                    "body": "<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>There is a high threat from violent crime and kidnapping throughout Venezuela, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Armed robbery, mugging, carjacking, and burglary are all common and are often accompanied by extreme levels of violence \u2013 do not resist an attacker. These crimes can occur on the street or the beach, in supermarket queues or when travelling in private vehicles or public transport, or indoors.  Remain alert and avoid using your mobile phone or displaying other electronic equipment or valuables on the street or in a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Private security services, including the use of armoured cars, are increasingly becoming the standard for business and official visitors and residents. Use of armoured vehicles is now common in Caracas, especially after dark and for transport to/from the airport.</p>\n\n<p>In Caracas, reasonably priced hotels can be found in safer areas such as Chacao district.  Do not visit \u2018barrios\u2019 (heavily populated slums), not even on organised tours, as these are unsafe.  British nationals walking in the Avila National Park have been robbed at knife/gunpoint. If you want to visit the Avila then stick to popular trails and times (usually the morning) and where possible, go in a group and with someone who knows the park.</p>\n\n<p>Only use pre-booked taxis rather than hailing them in the street. Hotels will normally book a taxi from a reputable company or supply their own vehicle service.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid public transport. A number of robberies at gunpoint have been reported on the Caracas metro. There are regular reports of passengers being robbed on public buses.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel\">Travel</h3>\n\n<p>The borders with Bonaire (sea) and Cura\u00e7ao (sea and air) re-opened on 3 April 2023, and borders with Aruba (sea) re-opened on 1 May 2023. The borders with Trinidad &amp; Tobago (air) re-opened from 13 May 2023. There are no direct air services between Venezuela and the USA. The land borders with Brazil and Colombia can take time to cross and can be dangerous. If you\u2019re planning travel in the region on any of these routes, contact your travel company for more information.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bol\u00edvar State. Occasionally, protests by locals have led to the closure (sometimes for days) of Canaima airport and main roads (eg parts of Road 10 between El Callao and the Brazilian border). Some  shortages of fuel and other essentials exist across parts  of the country.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of bribes being solicited by authorities at Maiquetia (Caracas) International Airport. Normal check-in for flights is 2-3 hours in advance. Police and immigration checks can be lengthy \u2013 passengers must ensure their bags pass a drugs enforcement check just after check-in. Departure taxes are normally included in the price of a ticket, except at Puerto Ordaz Airport. Check with your airline before paying anything extra.</p>\n\n<p>Do not make any non-official payments at airports and ask for a receipt for any customs duty payments you make.  If you bring any personal items or merchandise into the country with a total value of over US$1,000 which are considered to be \u201cnew\u201d, you will need to pay import duty.  Further details on import duty taxes can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://declaraciones.seniat.gob.ve/portal/page/portal/MANEJADOR_CONTENIDO_SENIAT/04ADUANAS/4.5PREGUNTAS_FRECUENT/4.5.html\">Venezuelan customs authority (SENIAT)</a> website (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>Tourist travel can often involve flying in light aircraft. There have been several accidents in recent years on the main tourist routes, including Los Roques, Canaima and Merida - some with fatalities. A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/index.php\">Aviation Safety network</a>.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out its <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx\">most recent audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Venezuela in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air and Avior airlines ROI (Avior Venezuela) which is banned from entering the European Union.  UK government officials have been told to avoid using both airlines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-to-and-from-maiquetia-airport-caracas\">Travelling to and from Maiquetia Airport (Caracas)</h3>\n<p>Criminal groups operate in the Maiquetia airport area. Members of these groups work inside the airport to spot passengers who appear to be wealthy and then inform car hijackers and muggers waiting on the roads outside the airport. Some passengers have been followed from the airport and assaulted on the way to or on arrival at their destination in Caracas. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery, electronic items or other valuables; don\u2019t bring large amounts of cash to Venezuela; and be alert at all times. Passengers have also been robbed when returning to their cars at the airport car park.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on the road between Caracas and Maiquetia airport during the hours of darkness. There are fewer cars on the road during this time and the risk of crime is much higher. Don\u2019t stay at an airport hotel unless you can make safe transport arrangements between the hotel and the airport.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies on buses travelling to Maiquetia Airport, and along Avenida Libertador in Caracas. Ideally, arrange to be met at the airport by friends, business contacts, or your tour operator. If that isn\u2019t possible, consider travelling by licensed taxi. If you have to take a taxi, use a licensed taxi from the official taxi rank outside the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of bogus taxi-drivers at the airport. Don\u2019t accept offers of transport in the arrivals hall and do not board a taxi if there are other passengers already inside the car.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re coming to Venezuela to work, bring a letter from your employer and your local contact organisation details (including a Spanish translation). There have been occasions when passengers have been asked for bribes at the airport. Exchange currency at official exchange booths only.</p>\n\n<p>The National Guard carries out random drug and security checks at Maiquetia Airport, particularly on departure. Departing passengers are sometimes asked to accompany an officer to a local hospital for an x-ray. Beware of bogus security officials; if you\u2019re in any doubt ask other airline or airport staff.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Heavy rains and lack of maintenance can affect road conditions. Seek local advice about your route before you set out, leave plenty of time for your journey and stick to the main roads. Avoid travelling after dark.</p>\n\n<p>You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel and particularly to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana areas of Bol\u00edvar State. Fuel shortages are fairly common across all parts of the country although were not as severe during 2021.  Fuel is best paid in a set amount of US dollars according to how much is needed, rather than simply filling up the tank. Change will normally not be given.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Venezuela using a British driving licence for up to 1 year. After that you will need to get a Venezuelan driving licence. Make sure you have copies of insurance documents, driving licence and passport with you at all times. Failure to produce documents can result in your vehicle being seized by the police.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular police and National Guard checkpoints throughout the country. Drive slowly through these and stop if asked to do so. There have been reports of attempts by the police and National Guard to extract bribes. Ask for a written record giving details of the offence and the officer\u2019s details.</p>\n\n<p>All vehicles must carry a spare tyre, wheel block, jack and reflector triangle. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal but common, especially during weekends. Many vehicles are in poor condition and drivers routinely ignore red lights. In the event of an accident, both vehicles must remain in the position of the accident until a traffic police officer arrives. Insurance companies will not pay claims on vehicles that have been moved without a police accident report.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid hitchhiking and cycling at all costs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n<p>There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against boats in and around Venezuela\u2019s waters, especially east of Puerto La Cruz and in waters between Venezuela and Trinidad. Take suitable precautions and avoid these areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beaches\">Beaches</h3>\n<p>The waters of the Caribbean can be deceptive. There are strong currents and undertows in some areas that can make swimming hazardous. Lifeguards and warnings are not normally in place.</p>\n\n<p>Security incidents are common on beaches at any time of day.  Beach clubs can offer better security as can going with people that know the area.</p>\n\n",

Detection methods are sophisticated and drug traffickers should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to severe penalties, including up to 2 years on remand before sentencing and then a lengthy prison sentence of between 8 and 15 years. Conditions in Venezuelan jails are harsh and dangerous, and among the worst in the region.</p>\n\n<p>You should carry identification with you at all times. You can carry a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. You may be asked to show a form of ID at any time by local security forces, particularly at police checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>Sex with a child (in Venezuela this means under 18 years old) is illegal. Offenders will face long-term jail sentences.</p>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not considered a crime in Venezuelan law. Public displays of affection, although not illegal, will most likely be frowned upon and may attract unwanted attention from locals and/or security forces, particularly at police checkpoints. Please note that local legislation does not recognise same sex partnerships/relationships in any capacity nor confer any civil rights to same sex partners as next of kin.  See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page for the LGBT community</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is poorly equipped for disabled individuals. Wheelchair ramps are available only at a few upmarket hotels and restaurants, as hardly any office, shop, or bank provides special facilities for disabled people, and wheelchair-accessible toilets are virtually non-existent. Very few disabled parking spaces are available</p>\n\n<p>It is an offence to photograph military or strategic installations including military airports and the Presidential Palace.

More complex treatments may require evacuation. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Public health facilities are poor, with frequent shortages of medicines and funding.
