There have been reports of harassment and violence against women.</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional incidents of fighting between groups in various districts around Timor-Leste, often but not always related to martial arts groups. These incidents often involve stone throwing and occasionally machetes and knives. Most happen at night.

The latest one ended on 28 November 2021.  Entry to national territory continues to be subject to screening. On arrival, all passengers travelling to Timor-Leste are required to present a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate showing that a full dose (two doses) have been received. The requirement to be in possession of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, has been lifted.</p>\n\n<p>You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quarantine-requirements\">Quarantine requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Travellers who have received a full vaccination (two doses) and are able to present a  valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate, are exempted from mandatory quarantine upon arrival. Travellers who have not received a full vaccination for COVID-19 shall undertake 10 days mandatory quarantine designated by the competent authorities of the Ministry of Health. Alternatively, they could undertake home quarantine provided that the facility is suitable and with the authorisation from the Director General of Public Health Service. Those travellers, who for some health reason are not able to be vaccinated against COVID-19, should bring a letter of justification from their doctor. Upon arrival it should be presented to the health authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing-on-departure\">Testing on departure</h3>\n\n<p>Those wishing to leave Timor-Leste will be subject to the entry requirement of their destination country.

In exceptional cases, the Government may introduce temporary border closures.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regular-entry-requirements\">Regular entry requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"visas\">Visas</h3>\n\n<p>A tourist visa costs US$30 and can normally be issued to the holder of a valid British passport on arrival at Dili International airport or Dili seaport, provided entry into Timor-Leste is regarded as being for a legitimate purpose. The visa will be valid for a single entry and will allow you to stay for up to 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>British Citizens intending to enter the country via the Indonesia (West Timor) land border crossing at Atambua/Batugade need to apply in Kupang for a tourism visa in advance. This visa will generally be valid for a single entry and a duration of up to 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>In Dili, tourism visas can be extended to a total of 90 days, for a fee.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to travel overland (rather than by the ferry) to the exclave of Oecussi you\u2019ll need to apply for an additional visa.  You must present your round trip ticket and complete the required forms at your nearest Timor-Leste embassy or consulate, or in Dili, prior to travel.
