You should remain vigilant at all times. UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism. Terrorism in Egypt Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt. Terrorism is a risk across Egypt, particularly in North Sinai. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include: Egyptian security forces religious sites large public gatherings places visited by foreigners The authorities in Egypt have a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers at important sites, critical infrastructure and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites. Recent attacks include: in 2022, an attack to the west of the Suez Canal targeting security forces within the city of Ismailiyah in 2019, at least 20 people killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo's Manial district in 2019, at least 16 people injured after an IED attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids in 2019, 3 security personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo's Darb al-ahmar district in 2018, a roadside blast killed 4 people on a bus near the Giza pyramids in 2018, gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Minya province killing 7 people. Daesh (formally ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack Terrorism during holiday periods There is a heightened threat of terrorism in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas in January). Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. See a list of public holidays on the Egyptian Presidency website. You should: follow the advice of Egyptian authorities be vigilant in crowds and large gatherings Airports and airlines Terrorists in Egypt have the intent and capability to target airport buildings and planes. The main threat is on the North Sinai Peninsula where Daesh operate with greater freedom, but terrorists are active throughout Egypt. Co-operate fully with security officials at airports and pay attention to security measures on flights from Egypt to the UK. Terrorist kidnap There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region's porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have taken foreigners, government officials and civilians hostage for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnappings are likely. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors.

This page reflects the UK government's understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full 'British Citizen' passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. If you're unsure how Tunisia's entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate All travellers On arrival in Tunisia, you may be asked to share your contact details and travel information with the authorities. Evidence of a hotel reservation is required to enter the country, and a small number of visitors have been denied entry into Tunisia, or delayed, for not being able to provide sufficient evidence of accommodation. This policy is not applied uniformly, and in most cases, if asked, an explanation of alternative accommodation arrangements will be accepted. Some British nationals of South Asian descent have been delayed, temporarily detained, or denied entry into the country by Tunisian immigration authorities at airports. This can cause distress and inconvenience. The British Embassy has raised this issue with Tunisian authorities. Entry to Tunisia is decided by Tunisian authorities, and the British Embassy cannot override decisions to refuse entry. However, if you have been subject to the above practices and wish to report it to us, contact the Consular team at British Embassy Tunis on +216 71 108 700. Check your passport and travel documents before you travel Passport validity If you are visiting Tunisia, your passport should be valid for the full duration of your stay. You don't need any additional period of validity beyond this. Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports. Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Visas For stays longer than 90 days, you will need a visa. You should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London for information on how to apply, If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable or if circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.\",\n","            \"metadata\": {\n","                \"content_title\": \"Entry requirements\",\n","                \"country_name\": \"Tunisia\",\n","                \"part_id\": 5.0,\n","                \"url\": \"/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia\"\n","            }\n","        }\n","    }\n","]\n","<class 'str'>\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"utLeHK-LJtfM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702485772936,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":28,"user":{"displayName":"David Farrell","userId":"17580088866539757700"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]}]}
